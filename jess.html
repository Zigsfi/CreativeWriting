       <h1>As We Sink</h1>
       <h2>Jess Silverman</h2>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always hate bringing him to the park. From the second I arrive, his thick fingers wrapped in my hand, the other moms turn and stare in unison. Their mouths part, bleached teeth are bared, and their eyes never once drop their film of condescension</span><span class="c1">.</span><span>&nbsp;In return, always, I allow my closed lips to stretch widely over my teeth to give the illusion of a smile. My eyebrows flick upward then settle beneath my freckled forehead, daring the other mommies to fuck with me today. I practice this look in the car several times before Tyler and I go in every Saturday.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;I go slide?&rdquo; he erupts. His words sound like they come from a megaphone underwater, but with how clearly I hear them we might as well be sinking together. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, go ahead Ty.&rdquo; I squeeze his hand before he pulls it out of my grip and trots away. &nbsp;I turn to go sit by the Mommy Entourage, or M.E. as Jamie calls them, because as much as I hate to sit with them I know it&rsquo;s far more lethal to make them my enemies. Because as much as I don&rsquo;t want to hear about another Little League game, I have to show Tyler that his mom is trying just as hard as him to make friends. Because even though I want nothing more than to change out of these dark wash jeans that accentuate the baby weight that&rsquo;s lingered for six years, I won&rsquo;t let my brain misfires create any more for him. Jamie reminds me this when I beg him to take Ty out for the third day in a row, gently explaining that he knows I&rsquo;m trying as hard as I can. He reminds me what I remind myself time and time again: it&rsquo;s not about me now. It&rsquo;s about us. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liz, Helen, and Abby sit across three benches, because their massive pocketbooks take up about as much space as they do. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh there you are Maggie!&rdquo; Liz chirps, prompting a string of similar coos from the rest of the M.E. &ldquo;I love Tyler&rsquo;s shoes! Where did you get them?&rdquo; She asked the same question last week, but I swallow my pride and tell her.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I picked them up at Stride Rite a week or two ago. He loves neon green right now, it&rsquo;s all he wants to wear,&rdquo; I say, mustering as much enthusiasm as I can without hurting myself. Last week I told her I ordered them online, but immediately that led to a look I interpreted as scrutiny. The M.E. doesn&rsquo;t need to know that I didn&rsquo;t get out of bed for most of the week I ordered them, that I slept endlessly and that even when I was awake my bones felt heavy with apathy. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quickly find Tyler in the park, watch him climb the ladder to the slide for what is probably already his fourth consecutive time. No one else seems to be waiting, so I leave him be. On the other side of Liz, Helen&rsquo;s mauve lips part in remembrance. Whenever we run into her elsewhere, Jamie remarks that it looks like she pushed blueberries into her lips and forgot to wash them off.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maggie, I just remembered a Broadway show I saw on ad for that made me think of you! Have you heard of </span><span class="c1">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime</span><span>?&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That show about the autistic boy! I heard it got great reviews!&rdquo; Abby smiles. They look at me expectantly. I know where it&rsquo;s going, but valiantly I battle the fight or flight signals my brain shoots through me.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;why did that remind you of me?&rdquo; I try to laugh after this, partly to diffuse their impending tension, but all that comes out is a weird strangled cough. It&rsquo;s for nothing, because Liz doesn&rsquo;t miss a beat. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, we just know how important it is for Tyler to get representation in the media. My mother saw the show, and she said it was so inspiring!&rdquo; I know she&rsquo;s trying, she&rsquo;s reaching out but regardless I feel my throat tighten. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He- Tyler isn&rsquo;t autistic, though. But yes, I agree, disability does need more representation in the media.&rdquo; I practically spit. </span><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s not; you know he&rsquo;s not. How could they know? You don&rsquo;t tell them, they&rsquo;re not your favorite people but they aren&rsquo;t vicious. Don&rsquo;t do this here. </span><span>My heart expands like a sponge, saturated with all the times I&rsquo;ve fought for him, the times I&rsquo;ve had to stomach information that I know I&rsquo;d never know how to forget. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyler&rsquo;s Auditory Processing Disorder has been called Autism so many times that at this point I shouldn&rsquo;t be wasting any energy clarifying. But after all of the real setbacks, having an incorrect one pushed on him can render me useless for an entire day.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took Jamie and I too long to notice. My depression had receded as soon as I met Ty and sure, he wasn&rsquo;t talking and sure, he wasn&rsquo;t pointing and sure other kids were learning faster, but I was a new mother. He could do no wrong, not with those googly brown baby eyes staring at me. When he laughed, I would almost forget that he was months older than the milestones he wasn&rsquo;t hitting. The delays, I decided, couldn&rsquo;t be real unless we took action. And that&rsquo;s when I started to retreat. It&rsquo;s when I sat for hours a day reading child development books, desperately looking for justification. Jamie and I read to Tyler at least six times a day. His babbling increased but as I realized the extent of his deficit I sunk into myself. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Ty&rsquo;s pediatrician, whose eyes seemed to dull as he referred us a neurologist. That&rsquo;s about when I stopped sleeping through the night. Dr. Rezumna, the neurologist, ended up diagnosing Auditory Processing Disorder, which basically means that the ear and brain don&rsquo;t communicate correctly. The brain and ear play a game of telephone with the outside world every time they interact, leaving Ty with sound not much clearer than what you would hear underwater. Jamie didn&rsquo;t hold my hand but he placed his over mine, which held the neurologist&rsquo;s chair in a death grip, and looked at Dr. Rezumna with a sobriety that has hardly left him since and asked, &ldquo;So where do we go from here?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie and I have spent the years since reading enough literature to write dissertations and have taken Tyler to see an eclectic palette of specialists: three speech therapists, two occupational therapists, an experimental sound therapist, two child psychiatrists, a child psychologist, an otolaryngologist to place plastic tubes in Ty&rsquo;s ears to help reduce fluid obstructions. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said his first word at two years old, I sobbed for hours because by that point I&rsquo;d convinced myself he&rsquo;d never speak. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; was a pretty useful word for him though, so much so that his next word didn&rsquo;t come for another week. But as we barreled through appointments and weeks and tests and calls, he learned. My god, he learned so fast I almost thought we were in the clear. My anxiety ebbed and flowed (mostly flowed) as different teachers gave me discouraging feedback and supposed &ldquo;experts&rdquo; were wrong as often as they were right. Jamie would console me, reminding me that none of them knew Ty like we did. And after sobbing for days I&rsquo;d come to the same conclusion and we&rsquo;d continue on our merry path of therapies and togetherness.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even on this merry path, his comprehension is several years behind where it should be.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even after every therapy under the sun he lashes out regularly because he doesn&rsquo;t have the words to express how he feels.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my son&rsquo;s never told me he loves me because how is he supposed to be working on anything other than trying not to let the world pass him by?</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not Autism. But it&rsquo;s not better.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moms are looking at me, and if they&rsquo;re embarrassed of their misdiagnosis they don&rsquo;t show it. I breathe slowly, trying to will away the breakdown I know will come later. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, how did your mother&rsquo;s birthday party go, Helen?&rdquo; I muster, reigniting the others. I collect myself and offer nods and two word responses for about forty-five minutes, more than grateful when Tyler hobbles over to me. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can we get ice cream?&rdquo; Dinner&rsquo;s pretty soon, but a full sentence is one of the few things I am unable to say no to. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go bud.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he say Maggie?&rdquo; Abby&rsquo;s question is innocent, and unlike most innocent questions this is one I can answer without a breakdown. Tyler&rsquo;s dialect is one I&rsquo;m fluent in, but I know his request sounded more like &ldquo;cah&rsquo;w&rsquo;geh ahcreem?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh he wants to go grab some ice cream before we go home. It was great seeing you!&rdquo; I gush. I pick up my pocketbook and the M.E. smiles warmly, more genuinely than I ever have upon seeing them. The energy I take to remind myself that I shouldn&rsquo;t be intimidated by their happiness and normalcy is ridiculous. They wave to Tyler, and he beams in recognition. He flails his hand in response. Jamie spent weeks working on waving, demonstrating tirelessly that yes, greeting someone with your palm out and vertical was different from your wrists flapping violently at your side. The day Ty figured it out Jamie wasn&rsquo;t even there. I told him about it that night, and he collapsed in relief like someone had slid his spine out. I&rsquo;m happy the M.E. gets to see my boy in action, though. Just watching him happily engage in the interaction, nonverbal though it is, soothes me. I kneel and kiss him on the cheek, a congratulations, before we leave the park hand in hand. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jarring but sing-songy beep plays as I open the door to Baskin Robbins. We approach the counter and are greeted by the heavyset blonde cashier who smiles politely at Tyler. &nbsp;He looks at her quizzically.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tha&rsquo; girl haza ver big tummy!&rdquo; Tyler declares. My face reddens. I&rsquo;m praying the girl didn&rsquo;t hear him, but her smile falters. She breathes heavily, holding her smile with the energy it takes Atlas to hold up the world.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What would you like today?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have-&ldquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;NO. I do&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tyler interrupts, wanting to order for himself, &ldquo;Chaw&rsquo;ct!&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Of course, he can&rsquo;t say the flavor he wants but when it comes to berating the cashier he&rsquo;s crystalline clear. </span><span>The cashier- Lexi, her nametag reads- looks at me with a cocktail of confusion and residual hurt.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry about him. He&rsquo;s had a long day,&rdquo; I sigh, &ldquo;Could he just have a small cup of chocolate ice cream please?&rdquo; Lexi nods quickly, happy to any aspect of her job that takes her away from me. I shove five dollars into the tip jar. I pay and book it out of there, holding Ty&rsquo;s ice cream in one hand and his clammy palm in the other. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty, c&rsquo;mere,&rdquo; I mutter as I pull him to the parking lot. I get down on my knee and try to make eye contact. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wha!&rdquo; He groans, exasperated. He&rsquo;s figured out that I&rsquo;m mad. He&rsquo;s not afraid, though. Jamie&rsquo;s the better disciplinarian. He says it&rsquo;s because as an attorney he deals with far worse, but I still think it&rsquo;s patience coupled with the perfectionist mannerisms that made me fall for him.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t say that people have big tummies. It can make them very sad.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. If someone looks funny or different, you can whisper it in my ear.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yoh&rsquo;r ear?&rdquo; he parrots.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. If someone has a big tummy, or a funny dot on their face, or their hair is a different color, or they&rsquo;re very short, or anything like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he decides. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So if someone has pink hair, what do you do?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at me vacantly, as though I&rsquo;ve switched languages entirely. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If someone has pink hair, you </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;say it, you come to me and you whisper &lsquo;Mommy, that person has pink hair!&rsquo;&rdquo; I plead. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a theory I learned once in a psych class that the person who gets bronze in the Olympics is usually happier than the one who gets silver. The reasoning says this is because even if that third place person didn&rsquo;t get make as much progress as he hoped, he still is thrilled he placed at all. Meanwhile, silver knows her goal is right there. Success and breakthrough and glory are just out of reach, and God does she wish her arms were longer and her brain quicker. She wishes she never got so close to success that she could almost taste it. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try one more time. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, if a girl has a big tummy what do you do, Ty?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cups his hand around my ear and whispers, &ldquo;Mommmmmmmy, she ha&rsquo; a big tummy.&rdquo; Gold. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fling open the back door of my blue Subaru and let him clamber into his seat. I slam his door and walk slowly around to mine, pausing for a minute to lean against my trunk. </span><span class="c1">Fifteen minutes. Fifteen more minutes and you&rsquo;ll be home and Jamie can handle dinner and you can breathe. Is he home yet? He hasn&rsquo;t texted or called yet. I&rsquo;ll call him in the car. </span><span>I finish circumnavigating my car and climb into the driver&rsquo;s seat.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mix CD I&rsquo;ve had for almost a decade begins to whir in the dashboard, trying to remember which of my go-to songs it was crooning before I turned off the car. The end of Meatloaf&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two Out Of Three Ain&rsquo;t Bad&rdquo; fades and cascades into the rumbling percussion that marks my favorite on the CD. I give in.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You walked into the parrrrrty, like you were walking onto a ya-acht!&rdquo; I wail, eager to have a minute of catharsis before-</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo; singing!&rdquo; Ty barks. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, fine.&rdquo; The drive home continues mostly in silence, punctuated only by my occasional humming and Tyler exclaiming, &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; upon seeing Jamie&rsquo;s car parked in the garage. </span><span class="c1">Oh, he&rsquo;s here. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get out of the car and Tyler slams into the unlocked door to the house so that he tumbles in. I get to the door a few seconds later to find him splayed on the hardwood floor of our living room. His eyes are wide and he reads my expression to determine how serious his fall is. I keep a poker face. He&rsquo;s taken tougher falls and I don&rsquo;t have the energy to let him see this tantrum through. He neutralizes in response, and only then do I look up to see Jamie on the couch a few feet away, watching. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything, only looks and sips something out of a glass. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re home early,&rdquo; I note, stripping off my coat. I follow Ty as he runs into the next room, and he bounces on the couch as I find a show for him to watch on On Demand. Once he settles down to watch an episode of </span><span class="c1">Curious George</span><span>&nbsp;that he&rsquo;s seen at least three times, I go back to the other room and sit next to Jamie. He still doesn&rsquo;t say anything, but he kisses me on the head as I sidle up next to him. It&rsquo;s then I notice the smell of Corona. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rough day?&rdquo; I ask. His head doesn&rsquo;t face me, and I can&rsquo;t quite place his gaze. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; he decides, finally. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That counterfeit case?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you drinking then?&rdquo; He drinks pretty regularly, but usually it&rsquo;s a beer with dinner or wine with me after putting Ty to bed. Jamie rarely drinks alone.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How was your day?&rdquo; he hedges. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. Went to the park-&ldquo; I remember the Autism comment and my suppressed attack from earlier manifests itself. My eyes sting. Jamie will deal with me solemnly and tenderly as usual, saying little but sharing the experience in a way that helps alleviate the ache.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Right. I&rsquo;m crying. I suck in air in hopes of stopping my voice from cracking.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The M.E. was saying at the park that they saw some show about an Autistic kid and told me it reminded them of Ty.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not even crying so much as my brain is being assaulted by emotion. I&rsquo;m not sad so much as physically overwhelmed by their benign remarks. Jamie stares into the wall, lifting his glass to his lips taking a slow sip. It&rsquo;s like waiting for a video to buffer. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So?&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So who cares? We know he&rsquo;s not. His behavior&rsquo;s not that different from someone Autistic, they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He could only sound more casual if he were reading baseball stats. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When&hellip; when you say he&rsquo;s not that different from someone with Autism-&ldquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mags,&rdquo; he cuts me off, &ldquo;Ty has major trouble with social interaction, he can&rsquo;t really read, his speech is garbled. We know that.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m still waiting for a &ldquo;but.&rdquo; I know any second he&rsquo;ll wash away the cons of Tyler&rsquo;s existence and remind me how much progress he&rsquo;s made and how the M.E.&rsquo;s words meant nothing because they were wrong. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; I prod. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Our son is seriously disabled. And it&rsquo;s really fucking hard to keep pretending that that&rsquo;s not the truth.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyler was never the silver medalist. According to Jamie, he doesn&rsquo;t even place.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He- he won&rsquo;t be like this always. He&rsquo;ll outgrow it. Something&rsquo;s gonna work.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How do you know? We&rsquo;ve been doing this for years. We&rsquo;ve tried everything and more, we&rsquo;ve lost years of our lives- and Tyler years of his- for what?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What the fuck do you mean, for what?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m shaking.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying, why are we putting him through all this if we don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;ll work? Just throwing new things in his face and hoping something will stick so he&rsquo;s not only delayed but he&rsquo;s being forced to try and catch up when at this point it&rsquo;s almost impossible,&rdquo; Jamie&rsquo;s voice has wavered between two notes for this entire speech, as though he&rsquo;s practiced it. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; I repeat. The word tastes like pennies. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nearly. Between you and Ty I don&rsquo;t know how we can keep doing all of this in a way that&rsquo;s healthy for anyone.&rdquo; And the other shoe drops.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You stopped going to therapy because it conflicted with the reading tutor. You&rsquo;ll spend days in bed when a test result comes back. How the hell are we supposed to take care of our son when you won&rsquo;t take care of yourself? Ty needs you to be consistent.&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any strong emotion is practically impossible to differentiate when it comes down the chemical aspect. Physiologically, when we are elated our bodies are identical to when we are enraged. I&rsquo;m having trouble placing my response to Jamie anywhere on the spectrum. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depression doesn&rsquo;t make me a bad mother. And it doesn&rsquo;t mean I should stop trying as hard as I can. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blink several times, as though I expect Jamie&rsquo;s face to disappear. But no, his under eyes, a grayish blue, continue to stare me in the face. His jaw isn&rsquo;t clenched but his lips are barely staying together. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you drunk?&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes roll a little. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had more than three beers. This isn&rsquo;t a drunk rant, but the alcohol is definitely making it easier to explain this to you.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How long have you thought that I was a terrible mother?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyebrows rise, but barely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, right, it&rsquo;s not. You&rsquo;re just saying that I do jack shit because I can&rsquo;t take care of my son properly. I&rsquo;m not a fucking doll, Jame. I get sad when I hear what these other mothers say but I don&rsquo;t have public meltdowns. And yes, when doctors doubt my son it upsets me, but I get up. I don&rsquo;t stop trying. You told me you knew that.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do, of course I know that. I just don&rsquo;t want to put you and Ty- hell me too- through any more bullshit if it won&rsquo;t even make a difference.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not making a difference? He waved goodbye to the moms today. I explained that he can&rsquo;t point out people&rsquo;s insecurities in public and he </span><span class="c1">understood.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He should have been able to wave years ago! He&rsquo;s hitting milestones for him, but he&rsquo;s being lapped again and again. He&rsquo;s not going to catch up, Mag.&rdquo; His voice cracks. Good, now we at least match.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you want to just give up? You want to stop trying just because he&rsquo;s not going to catch up immediately? I think we owe it to our son to help him get as far as he can. He&rsquo;s working so hard and I&rsquo;m not going stop helping him work just because he&rsquo;s not going to be the next Zuckerberg.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c1">kid</span><span>. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be working longer hours than a college student!&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer me before.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How long have you been thinking about this?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie exhales a breath I don&rsquo;t think he knew he was holding. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bad mother. You do more than Ty could ever hope for you to. I just don&rsquo;t want you to overextend yourself, or him. I worry about you.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You forget that I&rsquo;m an adult. I&rsquo;ve been dealing with my mental health for as long as I can remember, and I know it&rsquo;s scary that you can&rsquo;t manage it for me. But I know what I can take.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re an adult, I didn&rsquo;t mean to sound patronizing. Ty is great, he&rsquo;s doing great. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; I realize I haven&rsquo;t looked at him in a few minutes. I turn and his eyes are rimmed red.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jamie. How are you?&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know how much longer I can do this.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gestures to the air around him limply, like strings are pulling his arms. </span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It makes me so happy knowing you and Ty depend on me to be stable. But I&rsquo;m worried I can&rsquo;t be what you want me to be.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I see him, then. I see the hours he&rsquo;s given up making sure I&rsquo;m not lost to the world, lessons he&rsquo;s tried to teach me and Tyler both, being the one to keep us afloat. Between worrying about myself and about Tyler I had failed to see that someone equally important was underwater too.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to save me Jame. The only thing I need from you is to know that we will be there for each other. It&rsquo;s not about me. It&rsquo;s not about Ty. It&rsquo;s about us.&rdquo; He leans and rests his head on my shoulder. I stroke his hair the way I usually do Tyler&rsquo;s.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just,&rdquo; he struggles to find words, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so hard watching the other kids. It&rsquo;s so hard trying to be a voice of reason, when I stay up thinking &lsquo;Oh my god, what if our son has to live in a group home?&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to scare you, Mags but I get so upset and stressed and I can&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out how to express it without destroying someone in the process.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say those who are depressed and have mental disorders are selfish, that they crave attention more than they crave being helped. But that&rsquo;s not quite it. It&rsquo;s that when your brain turns on you, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone is going through the exact same situation. It&rsquo;s even harder to imagine that someone you know like the back of your hand is hiding something just as incriminating on your palm.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I open my mouth to speak when I hear the padding of our son&rsquo;s feet. His show has ended, and his face appears in the archway that separates the two rooms slack from a television-induced haze.</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie looks up at him. &ldquo;Hi, Ty. How are you, kiddo?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi. More?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In a sec, bud. Come sit with mommy and me.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sit?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, come here.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyler sits next to me, and I wrap my arm around his waist. I turn to Jamie. His eyes are red, but his shoulders have dropped the tension I hadn&rsquo;t realized they&rsquo;d held. So we sit, me and my boys, as a family that is finally learning to swim.</span></p>
