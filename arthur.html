    <h1>A Test of Faith</h1>
    <h2>Arthur Berman</h2>
    <p class="c0 c4 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Welcome, all. My name is Dialle, Priest of the Lord. Thank you for joining me tonight. Let us pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The crowd joined me, and as one, we closed our eyes and intoned, &ldquo;Oh Lord, whose will is in all things around us. We thank You, this day, for the power You have shown us, the strength You have given us, and the beauty You have surrounded us with. Lead us to salvation in Thy light, and show us the glory to be found in our devotion to You. In Thy kingdom, we rejoice. Amen.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; I repeated. I clapped my hands, raised my arms to the ceiling, and clutched my fingers, as though they grasped an unseen rope. &ldquo;Behold a miracle,&rdquo; I cried. An ornate wreath rose from the floor in front of me, as if lifted by unseen strings. &ldquo;The Lord is with us; watch as, through His power, we are lifted into His love.&rdquo; I brought my arms down, and the wreath followed, drifting gently back to the floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I began my sermon. &ldquo;Tonight, looking at all of you, I am humbled. Humbled that, in just four short years, this flock has grown, and become so much closer to the miracles of God. Four years ago, we were so different.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Four years ago, I was disappointed to see that the Friday sermon had attracted fewer followers than usual: the first rows of chairs were scattered with familiar faces, but the faces of my devoted became sparser as my gaze swept to the rear of the hall. The small pool of bills seeding the collection bowl by the door had barely been disturbed as the congregants trickled in; I was unlikely to make much profit on any Friday, but tonight&rsquo;s paltry offering was pitiful even by that standard. The plate-glass at the rear of the hall was mottled by falling rain, and blurry silhouettes strode by, occasionally pausing to make note of the flickering purple sign tacked to the window: </span><span class="c3">Come See A Miracle &amp; Rejoice in Faith</span><span>. From the street, my church blended with the convenience stores, laundromats, and bars that lined the city downtown. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;It was four years ago that our church experienced the first miracle of God, and saw Him visit us with His glory and power, to show us his power on Earth.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Four years ago, I had met a charlatan clandestinely in my office. The man, always dressed in an impeccable coat, a tie, and a wide-brimmed hat he refused to doff when he came to service, had been sitting at my desk looking through the unpaid bills, notices from the leasing company, and increasingly dire account notices when I entered the room. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What are you doing here? Who are you?&rdquo; I demanded, surprised to see this vaguely familiar figure in my office. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>He regarded me coldly before responding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an artist, my medium is spectacle. It seems you are in need of my services. You promise these people a miracle that will bring them closer to God, and you have nothing to show for it. I can offer you a new way to reach these people; a new way to help them achieve salvation. Observe.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>He produced from within his sleeve a small stone, laced with intricate carvings. With a wave of his hand, the stone was suddenly airborne, flittering around the room as though carried by a pair of wings. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I recoiled in shock. &ldquo;Demon!&rdquo; I spat, reeling backward and grasping for a cross or candle. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Not a demon, Priest Dialle!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an inventor. It&rsquo;s all a trick: magnets, misdirection. It looks like a miracle, but it&rsquo;s rooted in the power of mankind.&rdquo; He grinned, proud of the reaction his creation had elicited. &ldquo;I can rig up your entire church with this stuff; let you call on the miracle of modern technology.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;And lie to the congregation, tell them about the power of God and show them parlor tricks? That is an affront that I will not bare. I ask that you leave, and not return. You are not welcome here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Priest Dialle, Priest Dialle. You and I both understand that the true miracle of God is his love for all those who follow him. You&rsquo;ve seen your flock dwindle, you&rsquo;ve seen the people who pass your doors as they drown themselves in alcohol, lose themselves in lust and greed and gluttony. What I&rsquo;m offering you is the greatest miracle of all: a way to save these people, to show them that God loves them, and has great power on Earth still. And, Priest? You will lose everything if you can&rsquo;t reach these people. I can see the dire straits this wonderful church is in. How can you spread the message of God if you lose this place? How can you lead your flock to glory without a pasture? I can help you save these people, if you will let me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;And in exchange for what? You know I have nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I require very little, Priest. I need only your permission, and for you to agree to do something for me. When I do this, things will change for you forever. Do not allow yourself to become sinful in the newfound prosperity of your mission on Earth.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I am a holy man, sir. If this is a path to the salvation of many, I...I suppose it must be considered. Can you help me bring these people to god?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>He grinned again. &ldquo;The pact is sealed. By Sunday, you shall have the power to show these people miracles like they&rsquo;ve never seen before. I will be back in five years to see &rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I turned to open the door for him, but when I looked back he was gone. </span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Four years ago, I took my pulpit with a newfound understanding of God and His power. To honor that auspicious day in our history together, I will once again give the address I gave that day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I pulled a well-worn sheet of paper from my robes. &ldquo;Gathered friends and believers, God&rsquo;s miracles work over all of us. His power flows through all of us; His love surrounds all things on Earth. Rejoice, for we are his faithful, and his miracles work through us.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Four years before, I had looked down at the red switch underfoot. Since then, I had replaced that simple switch with an array of complicated controls, giving me a finely tuned control over the miracles I displayed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Behold, you faithful people. Behold the glorious power of the Lord.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I tapped my toe, and a great hum filled the hall. With a theatrical flair, I waved my hands at the offering trays as they levitated and drifted gracefully through the hall. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;His miracles have found us; he has blessed this church in power, and shown me to invoke his will as I see fit. Follow me, and we shall all learn these miracles together, and his power will flow through all of you as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I returned the page to my robes amidst the applause of my flock; the offering trays continued their slow drift around the room, weighed down by the enthusiastic contributions of the faithful. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Faithful friends, when we have the power of God, all things are possible. No obstacle can stymie us, no challenge can give us pause. In His light, we cannot be detained or restrained. How, then, can we avoid the temptation to use His power towards evil deeds? What is there to stop us from using His power to rob a bank, or bring ruin to a rival?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Power of God!&rdquo; screamed a voice from the congregation.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Power of God, indeed,&rdquo; I confirmed. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s power through us on Earth is nothing compared to his power, and just as He smites the souls of sinners as they come up to heaven, so too will He smite the souls of those who misuse His power on Earth. This is why His miracles must only be used to bring glory in His name on Earth.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I strode down from my pulpit into the congregation. &ldquo;Thank you for joining us this evening. The Lord is with you all. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to give as you leave.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I returned to my</span><span>&nbsp;office, grabbed some Oreos and a rocks glass, and poured a whiskey from the bottle I kept concealed behind the tapestries. I was taking a long, slow sip when a knock at the door interrupted me. Hastily, I straightened my robes, brushing off the chocolate and salt that had accumulated around my navel. I grabbed a stack of sermons from the pile on my desk and spread them out, covering the half-finished packet of cookies, before responding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You are welcomed. Come before me.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The heavy door creaked open slowly. A woman, wrapped so tightly in her shawl that I wondered if she would crumble without it, tottered in. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Priest Dialle,&rdquo; she said in hushed tones, &ldquo;I have sinned. I seek absolution in His eyes if He will hear it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;He hears you, Mrs. Tottenham. Sit with me and let us pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We sat opposite each other and prepared for the Miracle of Forgiveness. She closed her eyes and rolled her head to face the ceiling, swaying back and forth in her chair. I discretely tapped a button underneath the desk; a low hum filled the room from the small speakers in the wall, covering the clicking of an embedded tape recorder in the lamp and another above the door. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What is your sin, Mrs. Tottenham?&rdquo; My voice rolled deeply across the room, enhanced by a small microphone hidden inside the lapel of my robes. &ldquo;Speak it now, that I may carry it to the Lord.&rdquo; Her sins were never very useful, but her tithes were. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;My sin is pride,&rdquo; she moaned despondently. &ldquo;I have lapsed in my humility and now the Lord punishes me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;How have you lapsed, Mrs. Tottenham?&rdquo; I leaned towards her, subtly swiveling the lamp as I did. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I was having tea,&rdquo; she said, hiding a sniffle with her hand as she straightened up, &ldquo;with my friends, Betty and Phyllis. They were saying how I was silly to think so much of myself, that I didn&rsquo;t have the Lord&rsquo;s gift in me. I wanted so much for them to understand his glory, the way you showed me, so I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You tried to show them a miracle? Helen, you know how much training it takes to perform a miracle outside of the church.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I was so sure I could &ndash; you&rsquo;ve taught me so much and I&rsquo;ve felt my gifts growing so strong, but I couldn&rsquo;t. I just couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Lord works in his ways, Mrs. Tottenham. He punished you for your pride by depriving you of His blessings, as he shall continue to do until you have shown your humility has returned.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Tottenham. &ldquo;I want so dearly to show my humility, but&hellip; this month has been hard, and without the allowance my son Tim used to give me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Lord demands your faith, Mrs. Tottenham,&rdquo; I chastised. &ldquo;You must decide whether your earthly possessions are worth more than His grace.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she whimpered. &ldquo;Let me give Him what I have now, and then when I come for the service, I&rsquo;ll see what I have.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>A trembling hand reached out from the shawl, clutching a thin piece of green paper. I tapped a switch with my foot and, with a roar, a great current of air burst out of the floor, catching the bill and wafting it gently into a vent in the ceiling. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s accepted your offering, Mrs. Tottenham. Let&rsquo;s try a small miracle now and see if His grace flows down through you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I reached across the table, offering a small metal disk. &ldquo;Try and lift this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Mrs. Tottenham&rsquo;s frail hand reached out once again, grasping at the air. She hummed fervently, tracing patterns with her fingers and rolling her eyes back. She inhaled sharply as the disk lifted in the air; as it rose, her concentration lapsed into a relieved grin. Taking this as a sign that her humility was suitably restored, I disabled the magnets keeping the disk aloft; it dropped with a crack. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, Priest,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I will study scripture deeply tonight.&rdquo; She rose from her chair and hobbled out, stooping at the door to drop one last faded, crinkled bill into the offering basket. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow,&rdquo; I called after her, returning to the hastily hidden bottle behind the ornate wall hangings. My rocks glass was now a water glass; I finished the contents in a single gulp and poured the Makers, neat, in its place. Swallowing it, and three more after that, I returned to my desk. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I needed a sermon for tomorrow, maybe something about wrath or a warning about faith. I reached for my glass, saw it was empty, and pushed it aside. One of the sermons I had strewn across my desk would be right, if I could just find it. I reached for my glass and downed the contents, absently leafing through another pile. I considered the stack of passages about the Lord&rsquo;s love for his most devout, but decided something darker was in order. I opened the folder of brimstone, reaching for my glass again. I prepared to take another long sip, but something gave me pause. This would be my ninth or tenth whiskey of the night, but I couldn&rsquo;t recall the last time I had stood up to fill my glass. I peered at the bar: the bottle stood there, but had only half the liquid it did when I sat down for the evening. Had I not noticed myself fixing drink after drink? I stood up and immediately knew it was the first time in hours I had done so as I crashed to the floor. I gingerly crawled to the sofa, made the arduous climb onto the cushions, and decided I would wait until morning to pick a sermon. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Suddenly, it was morning. Light streamed in through the thin windows, landing precisely on my eyes. I winced, groaned, and hurled into the collection basket next to my head. Collecting myself, I stood up and glanced around the room. It was cleaner than I expected; typically, if I woke up in my office with a hangover, the room would be in shambles. I, in my stupor, had dutifully hung my robes to prevent wrinkles, organized the sermons on my desk into neat stacks, and sorted the money from the collections basket. How fortuitous that I had selected to heave into a ready receptacle. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I paced over to my desk, blocking the sun with one hand and steadying myself with the other. My evening had been more successful than I thought: a sermon sat on my desk, covered in scribbled notes. I scanned it quickly: &ldquo;The Candelabra - A test of faith.&rdquo; Good. The Candelabra was an exciting lesson that could be presented without too much preparation. I donned my robes, looked over the notes, and walked out to prepare for the congregation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>A suited man confronted me immediately. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Mr. Dialle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jerome Sommers, from the church and community audit department.&rdquo; He flashed a laminated card emblazoned with &lsquo;IRS&rsquo; and continued, &ldquo;We have reason to believe that this organization does not conform to our standards for a religious group. We were contacted by a gentleman named Timothy Tottenham&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;This discussion will need to wait, Mr. Soo-mers,&rdquo; I replied hastily, deliberately mispronouncing his name as a distraction. &ldquo;If you will join me, I&rsquo;m about to lead a Sunday service.&rdquo; Without waiting for a reply, I hurried forward through the double doors at the end of the corridor. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Of the pews in the hall, about two-thirds were filled. Of those, the front half could be depended on for substantial offerings, while the rest would diminish as they reached further to the rear. I mentally calculated what I could expect, before deciding the thudding headache was too much interference for my feeble mathematics talent. Glancing at Sommers, I took my place at the pulpit and began the service. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Lord is our strength from on high, our light when all around us is in shadow. In His name, we pray for our betterment on Earth, that we might join in his power in Heaven. So we pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;So we pray,&rdquo; echoed the congregation. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I launched into my lesson. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Some of you may have seen that the hall is dark today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The crowd murmured in assent. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Those of you in the front can see why. The ropes for one of our light fixtures came untied in the night and the whole candelabra came crashing to the ground.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>More murmurs. Some of the older members looked on expectantly; one or two of them whispered to neighbors. This was a lesson they knew well. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;When the light isn&rsquo;t lifted to the ceiling, it can&rsquo;t spread across the room, and everyone is shrouded in shadow. But when the faithful lift the light of the Lord for all to see, the shadow is purged and only light remains. So I ask you, are you faithful?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;We are faithful!&rdquo; they cried as one. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Then, all you faithful, let us return this light to its place.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>A great noise welled up as the congregation leapt to their feet, arms outstretched towards the lights. I tapped a small switch with my foot and a winch began to turn, wheeling the candelabra back to its place. I strode down until I was directly beneath the rising metal circle, arms outstretched. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Look at how the Lord&rsquo;s power is lifted by the faithful, and rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoi-&rdquo; A terrible crack interrupted me: the rope holding the heavy lights to the ceiling stretched taut and gave way, and the fixture plummeted. The whole world seemed to slow around me as the shimmering bars and chains fell towards my aching head. I impotently shielded myself, palms flat against the descending surface; my face cringed away from my doom as the chandelier slowly descended. Slowly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I looked around &ndash; the congregation was staring in shock. Gingerly, I looked up. The structure hung in the air, suspended by something unseen. Shrieking, I jumped away down the aisle, and felt glass shards patter against my back as the lights shattered on the ground. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Shaken, I rose to my feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle!&rdquo; shrieked a voice from the back. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your attention to the lesson today. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to give at the door.&rdquo; At a steady clip, I walked down the aisle back towards my office. Once the heavy door was closed behind me, I collapsed. What happened defied explanation &ndash; none of the trickery I so often employed could explain the candelabra hanging in the air the way it did. I reached out, and suddenly my glass, once again full, was in my hand. I gulped at it, letting it run down my throat before forcing myself to my feet. Whatever was happening had to have some sort of rational explanation. I sat down heavily at my desk, grabbing for the miracle disk. I contemplated it momentarily, before tossing it in the air and catching it in my hand. But it didn&rsquo;t land in my hand &ndash; it hung in the air before my eyes. It quivered there, almost expectantly, before the door burst open and it fell, inert, to my lap. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What are you playing at, Dialle?&rdquo; screamed Sommers accusatorily. &ldquo;What sort of two-bit trickery are you using here? This is twisted. Using ropes and mirrors to convince people that they are chosen by God? And throwing money at you for the privilege? It&rsquo;s over. As a duly appointed agent of the law, I hereby place you under arrest&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>His voice trailed off. The disk was once again hovering at eye level, and he noticed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What are you playing at? Another trick? I&rsquo;m not fooled &ndash; I can practically see the wire hanging from &ndash;&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>He was cut off more abruptly as I flicked my wrist, embedding the disk in the wall behind him and leaving a neat hole through his forehead. He collapsed, blood trickling out of the gash above his eyes and pouring from the wound at the base of his brain stem. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Christ. I once again raised a full glass to my lips, trying to process what I had done without thinking about it. Panic started to set in &ndash; there was nothing I could do, no way I could protect myself from this, no trick I could play or illusion I could render to reverse what I had done. I made my way to the door and clicked the deadbolt into place; members of the congregation were making their way down the hall towards me, clamoring for explanations of the miracle they had just witnessed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;So, I see you&rsquo;ve learned the true nature of your abilities,&rdquo; said a voice from the ground. Jerome Sommers, stood, adjusted his suit jacket, and pulled from his briefcase a wide-brimmed hat, which he affixed to his head. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; I cried, shocked. &ldquo;But... How? I thought I had killed you. Oh God, I thought I killed you.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t if you tried. Take a seat, Mr. Dialle. We have a great deal to discuss.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Your inventions...They were never put to work in this church.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Of course, Mr. Dialle. Magnets and misdirection could never work like this. It&rsquo;s scientifically impossible. I&rsquo;ve granted you access to a more powerful force: a deeper connection to the world around you.&rdquo; He stood, made his way to the bar, and poured two stiff drinks, before continuing. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;And oh, have you abused it. What did I tell you when we started? &lsquo;Do not allow yourself to become sinful.&rsquo; How deeply you have failed. Pride, sloth, gluttony&hellip; how far you have fallen.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I cried plaintively. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>He bristled, and suddenly, he was ten feet tall, glowing with a deep fire. &ldquo;I am an Angel of the Lord, and I condemn you, Dialle. I condemn you for your sins and name you apostate.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The light faded and he was Jerome Sommers again. &ldquo;But, I did say five years, and as you are no doubt aware, I am nearly a year early. Let us see what redemption you can find on Earth before I return.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>A great flash blinded me, and when I recovered from the daze, the lifeless corpse of Jerome Sommers was still slumped against the wall. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>My trial was swift, my sentence clear. For the crimes of proselytizing, fraud, and embezzlement, I lost the church and every cent I had earned. For the brutal murder of a federal employee, I was to spend twenty years in prison. Maximum security. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Welcome to Hull Maximum, Priest Dialle,&rdquo; Jerry said. Jerry was the only guard to treat me with any measure of dignity; his wife had been one of my congregation, and was still faithful, even with me behind bars. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much I can do for you, but I&rsquo;ll help where I can. Most folks here won&rsquo;t mind hearing that you whacked a tax-man.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>It was no reassurance; I was powerless. I had tried to lift rocks in my holding cell, tried to summon the key ring from the police desk, but any control over the power that killed Jerome Sommers had abandoned me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Hey, Priest!&rdquo; called a bald man whose pale neck and shoulders were adorned with parallel lightning bolts. He was across the yard with three other light-skinned men, all of whom sported a variety of unflattering iconography. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you joined up with us yet? We&rsquo;re starting to think you don&rsquo;t love your brothers,&rdquo; he declared as he strode towards me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;A holy man has love for all of God&rsquo;s children, Harry,&rdquo; I replied. The pious routine had spared me from attention so far. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t love all of &rsquo;em, Priest. Not in here. Probably about time you join up with God&rsquo;s true favorites. It&rsquo;s the only way we can be sure you don&rsquo;t have any trouble in here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>One of his cronies pulled a sharpened shard of metal from his waistband. &ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; he reiterated. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The flash of metal drew the attention of a massive hispanic man. &ldquo;Hey, Nazi! The fuck you doing on our side of the yard waving that thing around? Trying to start some shit?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The fuck does it matter to you, Santa&rdquo; the smaller man retorted. &ldquo;Stay the fuck out of our busi-.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>An earsplitting crack filled the yard as he was thrown to the ground. His motionless body was horribly contorted; Santa had already rounded on Harry and the other men. They had already drawn blades, and they fell on him like rabid wolves: flashes of chrome became splatters of red, and Santa collapsed to the ground, moaning softly as his body leaked blood. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Sorry, Priest,&rdquo; said Harry without any remorse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one of us, and we can&rsquo;t have you spreading shit about this. It&rsquo;s best you make peace with God quickly.&rdquo; He lifted his shiv to my throat, and I felt the pressure of the metal graze my adam&rsquo;s apple. I closed my eyes, waiting for the inevitable, but it never came. I looked up slowly. Harry&rsquo;s head was tilted at a horrible angle; his blade was embedded into the temple of the smaller nazi. I looked around, and noticed that every stone in the surrounding ten feet was hovering several feet off the ground. I collapsed, and as I lost consciousness I heard the pattering of everything falling back to Earth. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I spent the next few months in solitary confinement. I would roll out of bed half an hour early every day, grab a chunk of stone from beneath my pillow, and try to levitate it. At first, it would barely twitch. As the days passed, I developed more control, until I could embed them six inches into the concrete of my cell. One morning, my practice was interrupted by a knock on the cell door. Jerry was there with a message. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Dialle, you have a visitor,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an odd-looking fellow. Wears a big hat.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The angel. Had my year already elapsed? Impossible. I was sure I had at least six months left. I followed Jerry to a table in the visitors wing and took a seat; he took the seat opposite me, donning the same wide-brimmed hat I&rsquo;d seen him wear twice before. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>I suddenly noticed that I had seen the guard&rsquo;s face before. &ldquo;Jerry&hellip;Jerome, how did I not realize?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;My kind passes unseen more often than you might expect. A subtle hand is usually all we need to use.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What do you want, angel? I still have half a year left to find some sort of redemption.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Jerry&rsquo;s demeanor shifted. His noble features twisted slightly, taking on a crooked appearance. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got some bad news in that department. I just got the word from downstairs that your file has been fast-tracked to the fiery pits. I know we said a year, but turns out we were able to move your appointment up a bit. Killing a neo-nazi was a nice start, but you need to go a bit further than that to get any sort of absolution.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You never were an angel, were you?&rdquo; I asked, knowing the answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You were right the first time we met. Satan likes to send a few demons topside occasionally to stir up some trouble. It&rsquo;s always a hit with him when we can bring a holy man to ruin, especially when it goes as well as it did for you. You really did make it so easy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;So why are you here? You&rsquo;ve come to drag me with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;In a manner of speaking.&rdquo; He produced a small oval, which I immediately recognized as the miracle disk he gave me when we first met. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to end it. Do you want to, or shall I?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; I guess I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; I lifted the disk into the air, stared it down for what felt like hours, and drove it through my skull. </span></p>
