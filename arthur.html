        <h1>A Test of Faith</h1>
        <h2>Arthur Berman</h2>
        <p class="c0"><span>My office had an oak desk, and I loved it. There were other luxuries: ornate candelabra, an elegant carpet, and a well-stocked bar hidden behind one of the ceremonial tapestries that lined the walls. I was gathering the heavy cloth off to the side, rocks glass in hand, when a knock at the door interrupted me. Hastily, I straightened my robes, brushing off the chocolate and salt that had accumulated around my navel. I grabbed a stack of sermons from the pile on my desk and spread them out, covering the half-finished packet of oreos, before responding.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You are welcomed. Come before me.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>The heavy door creaked open slowly. A woman, wrapped so tightly in her shawl that I wondered if she would crumble without it, tottered in. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Priest Dialle,&rdquo; she said in hushed tones, &ldquo;I have sinned. I seek absolution in His eyes if He will hear it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;He hears you, Mrs. Tottenham. Sit with me and let us pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>We sat opposite each other and prepared for the Miracle of Forgiveness. She closed her eyes and rolled her head to face the ceiling, swaying back and forth in her chair. I discretely tapped a button underneath the desk; a low hum filled the room from the small speakers in the wall, covering the clicking of an embedded tape recorder in the lamp and another above the door. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What is your sin, Mrs. Tottenham?&rdquo; My voice rolled deeply across the room, enhanced by a small microphone hidden inside the lapel of my robes. &ldquo;Speak it now, that I may carry it to the Lord.&rdquo; Her sins were never very useful, but her tithes were. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;My sin is pride,&rdquo; she moaned despondently. &ldquo;I have lapsed in my humility and now the Lord punishes me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;How have you lapsed, Mrs. Tottenham?&rdquo; I leaned towards her, subtly swiveling the lamp as I did. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I was having tea,&rdquo; she said, hiding a sniffle with her hand as she straightened up, &ldquo;with my friends, Betty and Phyllis. They were saying how I was silly to think so much of myself, that I didn&rsquo;t have the Lord&rsquo;s gift in me. I wanted so much for them to understand his glory, the way you showed me, so I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You tried to show them a miracle?! Helen, you know how much training it takes to perform a miracle outside of the church.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I was so sure I could &ndash; you&rsquo;ve taught me so much and I&rsquo;ve felt my gifts growing so strong, but I couldn&rsquo;t. I just couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Lord works in his ways, Mrs. Tottenham. He punished you for your pride by depriving you of His blessings, as he shall continue to do until you have shown your humility has returned.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Tottenham. &ldquo;I want so dearly to show my humility, but&hellip; this month has been hard, and without the allowance my son Timmy used to give me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Lord demands your faith, Mrs. Tottenham,&rdquo; I chastised. &ldquo;You must decide whether your earthly possessions are worth more than His grace.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she whimpered. &ldquo;Let me give Him what I have now, and then when I come for the service, I&rsquo;ll see what I have.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>A trembling hand reached out from the shawl, clutching a thin piece of green paper. I tapped a switch with my foot and, with a roar, a great current of air burst out of the floor, catching the bill and wafting it gently into a vent in the ceiling. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s accepted your offering, Mrs. Tottenham. Let&rsquo;s try a small miracle now and see if His grace flows down through you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I reached across the table, offering a small metal disk. &ldquo;Try and lift this.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Mrs. Tottenham&rsquo;s frail hand reached out once again, grasping at the air. She hummed fervently, tracing patterns with her fingers and rolling her eyes back. She inhaled sharply as the disk lifted in the air; as it rose, her concentration lapsed into a relieved grin. Taking this as a sign that her humility was suitably restored, I disabled the magnets keeping the disk aloft; it dropped with a crack. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, Priest,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I will study scripture deeply tonight.&rdquo; She rose from her chair and hobbled out, stooping at the door to drop one last faded, crinkled bill into the offering basket. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow,&rdquo; I called after her, returning to the hastily hidden bottle behind the ornate wall hangings. My rocks glass was now a water glass; I finished the contents in a single gulp and poured the Makers, neat, in its place. Swallowing it, and three more after that, I returned to my desk. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I needed a sermon for tomorrow, maybe something about wrath or a warning about faith. I reached for my glass, saw it was empty, and pushed it aside. One of the sermons I had strewn across my desk would be right, if I could just find it. I reached for my glass and downed the contents, absently leafing through another pile. I considered the stack of passages about the Lord&rsquo;s love for his most devout, but decided something darker was in order. I opened the folder of brimstone, reaching for my glass again. I prepared to take another long sip, but something gave me pause. This would be my ninth whiskey of the night, but I couldn&rsquo;t recall the last time I had stood up to fill my glass. I peered at the bar: the bottle stood there, but had only half the liquid it did when I sat down for the evening. Had I not noticed myself fixing drink after drink? I stood up and immediately knew it was the first time in hours I had done so as I crashed to the floor. I gingerly crawled to the sofa, made the arduous climb onto the cushions, and decided I would wait until morning to pick a sermon. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Suddenly, it was morning. Light streamed in through the thin windows, landing precisely on my eyes. I winced, groaned, and hurled into the collection basket next to my head. Collecting myself, I stood up and glanced around the room. It was cleaner than I expected; typically, if I woke up in my office with a hangover, the room would be in shambles. I, in my stupor, had dutifully hung my robes to prevent wrinkles, organized the sermons on my desk into neat stacks, and sorted the money from the collections basket. How fortuitous that I had selected to heave into a ready receptacle. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I paced over to my desk, blocking the sun with one hand and steadying myself with the other. My evening had been more successful than I thought: a sermon sat on my desk, covered in scribbled notes. I scanned it quickly: &ldquo;The Candelabra - A test of faith.&rdquo; Good. The Candelabra was an exciting lesson that could be presented without too much preparation. I donned my robes, looked over the notes, and walked out to prepare for the congregation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>A suited man confronted me immediately. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Mr. Dialle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jerome Sommers, from the church and community audit department.&rdquo; He flashed a laminated card emblazoned with &lsquo;IRS&rsquo; and continued, &ldquo;we have reason to believe that this organization does not conform to our standards for a religious group. We were contacted by a gentleman named Timothy Tottenham&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;This discussion will need to wait, Mr. Soo-mers,&rdquo; I replied hastily, deliberately mispronouncing his name as a distraction. &ldquo;If you will join me, I&rsquo;m about to lead a Sunday service.&rdquo; Without waiting for a reply, I hurried forward through the double doors at the end of the corridor. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Of the thirty pews in the hall, twenty-two were filled. Of those twenty-two, the front half could be depended on for substantial offerings, while the rest would diminish as they reached further to the rear. I mentally calculated what I could expect, before deciding the thudding headache was too much interference for my feeble mathematics talent. Glancing at Sommers, I took my place at the pulpit and began the service. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;The Lord is our strength from on high, our light when all around us is in shadow. In His name, we pray for our betterment on Earth, that we might join in his power in Heaven. So we pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;So we pray,&rdquo; echoed the congregation. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I launched into my lesson. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Some of you may have seen that the hall is dark today.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>The crowd murmured in assent. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Those of you in the front can see why. The ropes for one of our light fixtures came untied in the night and the whole candelabra came crashing to the ground.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>More murmurs. Some of the older members looked on expectantly; one or two of them whispered to neighbors. This was a lesson they knew well. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;When the light isn&rsquo;t lifted to the ceiling, it can&rsquo;t spread across the room, and everyone is shrouded in shadow. But when the faithful lift the light of the Lord for all to see, the shadow is purged and only light remains. So I ask you, are you faithful?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;We are faithful!&rdquo; they cried as one. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Then, all you faithful, let us return this light to its height.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>A great noise welled up as the congregation leapt to their feet, arms outstretched towards the lights. I tapped a small switch with my foot and a winch began to turn, wheeling the candelabra back to its place. I strode down until I was directly beneath the rising metal circle, arms outstretched. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Look at how the Lord&rsquo;s power is lifted by the faithful, and rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoi-&rdquo; I was interrupted by a terrible crack &ndash; the rope holding the heavy lights to the ceiling stretched taut and gave way, and the fixture plummeted. The whole world seemed to slow around me as the shimmering bars and chains fell towards my aching head. I impotently shielded myself, palms flat against the descending surface; my face was wrapped in a cringe as the chandelier slowly descended. Slowly. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I looked around &ndash; the congregation was staring in shock. Gingerly, I looked up. The structure hung in the air, suspended by something unseen. Shrieking, I jumped away down the aisle, and felt glass shards patter against my back as the lights shattered on the ground. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Shaken, I rose to my feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle!&rdquo; shrieked a voice from the back. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your attention to the lesson today. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to give at the door.&rdquo; At a steady clip, I walked down the aisle back towards my office. Once the heavy door was closed behind me, I collapsed. What happened defied explanation &ndash; none of the trickery I so often employed could explain the candelabra hanging in the air the way it did. I reached out, and suddenly my glass, once again full, was in my hand. I gulped at it, letting it run down my throat before forcing myself to my feet. Whatever was happening had to have some sort of rational explanation. I sat down heavily at my desk, grabbing for the miracle disk. I contemplated it momentarily, before tossing it in the air and catching it in my hand. But it didn&rsquo;t land in my hand &ndash; it hung in the air before my eyes. It quivered there, almost expectantly, before the door burst open and it fell, inert, to my lap. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What are you playing at, Dialle?&rdquo; screamed Sommers accusatorily. &ldquo;What sort of two-bit trickery are you using here? This is twisted. Using ropes and mirrors to convince people that they are chosen by God? And throwing money at you for the privilege? It&rsquo;s over. As a duly appointed agent of the law, I hereby place you under arrest&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>His voice trailed off. The disk was once again hovering at eye level, and he noticed. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What are you playing at? Another trick? I&rsquo;m not fooled &ndash; I can practically see the wire hanging from &ndash;&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>He was cut off more abruptly as I flicked my wrist, embedding the disk in the wall behind him and leaving a neat hole through his forehead. He collapsed, blood trickling out of the gash above his eyes and pouring from the wound at the base of his brain stem. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Christ. I once again raised a full glass to my lips, trying to process what I had done without thinking about it. Panic started to set in &ndash; there was nothing I could do, no way I could protect myself from this, no trick I could play or illusion I could render to reverse what I had done. I heard members of the congregation making their way down the hall towards me, clamoring for explanations of the miracle they had just witnessed. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>The disk was hovering again, floating towards me. I looked at it for what felt like an eternity before tearing my gaze away and, with another flick of my wrist and a sudden shock to my temple, I let myself be shrouded in darkness. </span></p>
