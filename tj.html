        <h1>A Family&rsquo;s Duty</h1>
        <h2>By: T.J. Muzzonigro</h2>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter Jason&rsquo;s grandfather, a boisterous Italian, picked him up for a hug. Michael was in town for his grandson&rsquo;s first communion. Michael was a dominating presence, he stood six feet three inches and weighed about two-hundred and fifty pounds of muscle mixed with typical grandpa weight. &nbsp;His salt and pepper hair was more pepper than salt and his teeth seemed to shine brighter than the star he sang about in &ldquo;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&rdquo; to Peter Jason&rsquo;s younger sister. More prevalent than his physical appearance however, was Michael&rsquo;s radiating personality. From singing &ldquo;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&rdquo; at restaurants, to how his hands moved like a busy New York City intersection, while he told stories or captivated conversations. He was a man who could not be ignored. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peter Jason&rsquo;s first communion might have been one of the happiest days of Michael&rsquo;s life, aside from a few monumental occasions such as his marriage to his wife, the birth of his three sons, and the birth of his two grandchildren. On Peter Jason&rsquo;s communion the sun shone brightly through the clouds and all of Michael&rsquo;s family was there his wife, his sons, his daughter in law whom he treated like a daughter of his own blood, and most importantly his two grandchildren were there. Michael led his family into St. Francis Church, he ushered Peter Jason to the stage where he was supposed to align with the other children who were to receive their first communion. As he sat back down with the rest of his family Dominique climbed onto his lap. The men of the family wore fine tailored suits, including young Peter Jason who wore a loose fitting blue suit. Michael was not one to hide his emotions and cried as Peter Jason received his first communion. He stood up and hugged Peter Jason and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you.&rdquo; He tilted Peter Jason&rsquo;s chin so that he looked his grandfather in the eye. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Peter Jason asked, &ldquo;That thing tasted like cardboard.&rdquo; Michael laughed and ruffed up Peter Jason&rsquo;s blonde hair. Peter Jason&rsquo;s father, James, looked on with a beaming smile at the interaction of his favorite men on the planet. As they exited the church Michael picked up Peter Jason onto his shoulder and carried him off like he was the winning quarterback of the super bowl. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they arrived back at the suburban home of Peter Jason and his family, they changed out of their suits and dresses and went down to the neighborhood tot lot to play some basketball, Dominique tagged along, as she only wanted to go on the slides. Their family dogs, three Labradors, loved to go to the park and went nuts when Michael was in town as he always fed them extra slivers of food, even though they weren&rsquo;t supposed to be allowed any. As Michael and James walked back from the park each steering a satisfied dog, he spoke to his son. &ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo; He exclaimed pointing his arms to each side and gesturing to the park where small birch trees lined the gravel path, to the blacktop court covered in chalk from James&rsquo; brothers and Dominique, to the field lined by cat tails that signal the end of the park and the beginning of the forest. He gestured to his son&rsquo;s home that had a beautiful yard of green grass, to his daughter in-law standing in the door yelling down for them to come get ready for dinner. &ldquo;You made it. You have given your kids every opportunity they could need, a great school, a great home, a great neighborhood with great friends. I&rsquo;m so proud of you&hellip;. If only your brothers could figure this out.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">James was proud to be hearing this from his father, a man who once was so mad punched a hole in their home after an underage James tried to buy liquor from a store that was in the process of being in a VICE operation. However, he felt disappointed that his father still felt this way about his brothers. Stephen, the middle child, had a successful auto repair company and Logan, the youngest, worked for Stephen and was working his way up the management chain. James learned from his father to always see the positive in things, which is why he was always, confused about his fathers feeling towards his other sons. &ldquo;Pop, why are you so hard on them?&rdquo; James asked quizzically. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t love them&hellip;.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know you love them. No one has ever questioned that.&rdquo; James interjected before Michael could finish. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Michael struggled with what he was feeling, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just I want them to have what you have. It&rsquo;s all I want.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t judge them on my standard, everyone has their own standard.&rdquo; James looked his father in his ocean blue eyes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that taught me that. Come on now lets go get ready for dinner.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on, I have to tell you something.&rdquo; Michael pleaded. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it wait? Sarah is waiting for us to get back.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;James&hellip;. yeah it can wait.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They reached the door and James gave Sarah a kiss, she gave him a look of worry wondering what him and his father were discussing. &ldquo;Clean up nice&rdquo; she directed both of them, &ldquo;were going downtown for dinner tonight.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they arrived downtown at the Italian restaurant on Fifth Avenue, the aroma of fresh pizza swarmed the group&rsquo;s nostrils, with Peter Jason exclaiming, &ldquo;Can we get pizza? I want a pepperoni pizza!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tonight you can get a whole pizza to yourself.&rdquo; His grandfather explained stealing a glance at Peter Jason&rsquo;s mother to make sure it was okay. She nodded approvingly. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A whole pizza? Are you serious? Lets go!&rdquo; Peter Jason shook with excitement as he ran to open the door for his family as his father always taught him. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The family enjoyed a wonderful meal; Peter Jason ordered a whole pizza and only ended up eating two slices after the amount of appetizers Michael ordered. Michael made sure to clean up Peter Jason&rsquo;s plate. &ldquo;Could we please have the bill?&rdquo; James asked the cute waitress. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she walked away Michael grabbed her arm and whispered, &ldquo;Hon, it was my grandson&rsquo;s first communion today could you get him something special? Also, I&rsquo;ll take care of the bill.&rdquo; He asked as he slipped her a credit card away from the eyes of James. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she came back she carried a brownie sundae with a candle on top and placed it in front of Peter Jason, he blew out the candle and shoved his face into the brownie much to the displeasure of his mother. Everyone at the table bellowed with laughter, none louder than Michael at the head of the table. He grabbed the receipt to sign and James, realizing what his father did threw his hands up in frustration. &ldquo;I said I would handle tonight.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nonsense, it&rsquo;s my grandson&rsquo;s big day. Plus I wont see you guys for a while.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean? I thought you were coming for thanksgiving?&rdquo; James questioned his father. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, just let me handle this.&rdquo; He gave James a look that said don&rsquo;t push further, a look James had seen plenty of times growing up. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">They finished the night watching a comedy at home with Dominique falling asleep in Michael&rsquo;s arms and Peter Jason sprawled sleeping on the floor. The next morning Michael and James were awake before anyone else, sipping coffee, they sat on the deck watching the sun paint the sky orange and purple as it rose from slumber. James wanted to know what Michael had to say the day before. &ldquo;Pop, what did you want to tell me yesterday?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Son&hellip;&rdquo; Michael&rsquo;s eyes welled with tears, &ldquo;I have cancer.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What kind? What&rsquo;s your diagnosis?&rdquo; James shook as he spoke. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stage four prostate cancer, they said I have anywhere from a couple months to a year and a half.&rdquo; He cried harder now as the tears formed rivers down his cheeks. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! There has to be something we can do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already started the first rounds of experimental chemo, we&rsquo;re hopeful that slows the progression and I can make it longer. Don&rsquo;t worry son, I&rsquo;ll beat this.&rdquo; He spoke uncertainly as this was the first time in his life he seemed truly scared for his future. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you want to tell Peter Jason? He&rsquo;ll be devastated.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;ll tell him later today before we leave.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was eight years ago. He believed his grandson&rsquo;s first communion would be one of the last happy days of his life. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; Peter Jason forced a smile as he saw his once towering grandfather hunched, struggling to get out of his chair to say hello. His once salt and pepper hair now all salt with no pepper, however the one thing he hadn&rsquo;t lost was his personality or his faith. But personality isn&rsquo;t always the first thing to be seen, the first thing Peter Jason noticed was Michael&rsquo;s weight loss, Peter Jason could feel his grandfather&rsquo;s bones through his over worn sweater. &nbsp;All the family was in town for Michael&rsquo;s seventieth birthday party, it was also viewed as the last time to see their grandfather as his experimental treatments were failing and the doctors didn&rsquo;t know how much longer he had to live. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My how you&rsquo;ve grown,&rdquo; Michael felt his grandson&rsquo;s arms and slapped his chest, &ldquo;did you know you&rsquo;re now the largest person in our family?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What about your dad wasn&rsquo;t he bigger than me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you have him by an inch or two and probably fifty pounds at that too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How have you been feeling? You doing okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about old me, I&rsquo;ll get through. How&rsquo;s your dad holding up?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing alright. He&rsquo;s upset that you guys still haven&rsquo;t made your advanced directive. Other than that he just wants to make sure you and grandma are getting around okay. I worry too,&rdquo; Peter Jason said his voice trembling, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo; He began to cry in his grandfather&rsquo;s arms. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always be watching down.&rdquo; His grandfather rubbed Peter Jason&rsquo;s shoulder and they sat down for the meal with Peter Jason&rsquo;s father looking over to make sure he was doing all right. Afterwards Michael gave Peter Jason twenty dollars, Peter Jason rejected but Michael had a way of convincing people. On their family&rsquo;s drive home from New York Peter Jason contemplated a lot. He mainly thought about the fact that last week he had given his parents a thousand dollars, his entire savings account, in order for them to keep his grandparents afloat. That was the reason he didn&rsquo;t want to accept his grandfather&rsquo;s gift, it was as if he was giving him back his own money. Peter Jason didn&rsquo;t understand why his grandparents still tried to live the same exuberant life that they lived when his grandfather was car salesman of the year in the tri-state area. They were paying for two houses; they were paying for Michael&rsquo;s experimental treatments and for Lucy&rsquo;s, Michael&rsquo;s wife, depression medicine. Now the money was gone and Peter Jason&rsquo;s parents were supporting them. It lead to countless nights where Peter Jason could hear his parents whispering in their bedroom, conversations usually ending in James telling Sarah that everything would be fine and he would pick up some extra cases in the month. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Jason was under a lot of stress lately, applying to college, tying to understand his girlfriend, and thinking of his grandfather. One day in class he was daydreaming back to his first communion and himself trying to eat a whole pizza, something the current version of himself could do easily now. Another student tapping his shoulder, asking about how to set up a physics lab drew him out his thoughts. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Peter Jason barked. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just was wondering how we set this up.&rdquo; He said pointing to a system of car and a pulley. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, just ask someone else.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just shut the fuck up and sit back down&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh you think your hot shit cause you&rsquo;re the big guy on the lacrosse team?&rdquo; The kid snapped, pushing his finger into Peter Jason&rsquo;s chest. Peter Jason blew his normal calm demeanor and threw the kid into the desk next to the lab. The kid jumped back up and threw a wild haymaker that whizzed by Peter Jason&rsquo;s nose, Peter Jason could feel the wind blow his hair from his face. As he dodged the punch Peter Jason kicked the kid in the leg and saw him fall to his knees. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I told you to leave me alone.&rdquo; Peter Jason spoke with a trembling voice, in fear of his inner demons. He was restrained by two teachers and escorted down to the principles office. He began with an apology filled with tears. &ldquo;Principal Lovecraft, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I just lost my cool, I was thinking about my grandparents and just didn&rsquo;t want to deal with him. I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;. I&rsquo;m rambling&rdquo; Principal Lovecraft understood his pain as he had just lost his father to a battle with cancer. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I feel your pain Peter, I truly do. But you understand I still have to punish you. You&rsquo;re suspended for one week, your teachers will send your work home with your sister.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes sir. I&rsquo;m guessing its my time to go home now, just please let me tell my parents myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you do that&hellip;but I will wait to make the phone call to give you some time.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you&hellip; again I&rsquo;m very sorry. See you soon.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Jason clenched the wheel tightly and had the windows down letting rain sting his face as he drove home. He needed to clear his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bully, I&rsquo;ve never gotten in fights, I&rsquo;m certainly not a bad person. Am I?&rdquo; These thoughts pounded his head like a rocky hurricane, &ldquo;I just let my emotions get the best of me. I should just drive for a while.&rdquo; His thoughts were cut off as he pulled up the driveway to his house, he could see his mother through one of the windows, and she looked confused as to why Peter Jason would be home so early. &ldquo;Mom before you ask any questions, I&rsquo;m suspended.&rdquo; He let out an exasperated breath. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened? Is everything, everyone okay?&rdquo; She sat down, pondering what could have happened. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me and a kid got in a scuffle, it wasn&rsquo;t anything serious just a little misunderstanding.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter that&rsquo;s no reason to get into a fight. I can&rsquo;t even call your father, he&rsquo;s working too hard to help our parents so you can&rsquo;t be making him deal with this kind of thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know, I was thinking back to some memories of grandpa before it all happened, I was already upset. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo; her eyes welled with tears, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo; she brought her son in. He could feel the cold tears pop against his face as they embraced, &ldquo;Its going to be alright, you cant worry about grandpa, whatever is going to happen will happen and we will have to be there to support your father.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, what about you and dad? You guys have been supporting them all this time. It&rsquo;s clearly wearing on dad.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll keep going like he always does. Just stay strong for dad and we will all get through this. You need to focus on you applications for school and finishing out senior year right. Without getting in anymore trouble.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Jason finished his senior year without another incident, he was presented as team MVP of the lacrosse team, and was accepted into Georgetown University to study economics and play lacrosse. He had made small but great group of friends at the beginning of the semester, his room was constantly filled with at somebody who was playing videogames when they weren&rsquo;t at lifts or study halls. Peter Jason struggled to tell his friends about his grandfather and his feelings regarding it. It wasn&rsquo;t until late in the semester towards finals that his friends found out because of some serious developments in his family&rsquo;s life. These developments came when one day Peter Jason&rsquo;s phone range, he saw it was his dad so he knew something was off. Peter Jason called his mom a couple times a week but he rarely called his dad about things other than serious matters such as work or grades. He answered the phone, &ldquo;Dad, what&rsquo;s up? Everything alright?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No&hellip; I&rsquo;m on my way to New York.&rdquo; Peter Jason sat down perplexed as something was seriously wrong, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your grandma, she tried to kill herself.&rdquo; Peter Jason felt tears crawl up into his eyes but didn&rsquo;t feel the chill of the tears on his cheeks but instead felt his stomach boil with anger. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How? Why?&rdquo; He was almost screaming at his dad, &ldquo;How could she do that to grandpa, to us?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter you got to understand your grandmother has been depressed for a long time now and with grandpa getting worse her mood has gotten worse too. You can&rsquo;t blame her. She swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills, but luckily grandpa found her and called an ambulance.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So she&rsquo;s going to live? What&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Peter Jason felt ashamed of his grandmother, as he couldn&rsquo;t see why she would rob her husband of her joy, the one thing he told Peter Jason kept him going.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She got a small hole put in her throat in order to allow her to breath initially. She has to be watched under constant care for a while. And with her sick, grandpa is also going to need taken care of so they are coming to live with us. We have to fix up the basement since they cant deal with the stairs everyday. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Get me home to help.&rdquo; Peter Jason demanded from his father. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you have a test this week and you&rsquo;re coming home for thanksgiving in a few weeks.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo; His father said sternly as his main priority was his son doing well in school, &ldquo;Our friends in the neighborhood have already begun to help and it is still probably a week until they move in.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Call me later. Love you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Love you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Jason&rsquo;s friends were in his room and could see the mix of sadness and anger on his face. &nbsp;They asked to see if Peter Jason wanted them to leave the room, but he said no. He just wanted to play some videogames and push these feelings away, being the good friends they were they did what he wanted and tried to help take his feelings by distracting him with music or jokes, whatever they could do. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides his initial sadness and anger Peter Jason felt helplessness during the week as he talked to his mom about how hard the neighborhood had been working and how they needed help with the bigger items. He couldn&rsquo;t understand what good he was doing here at school, while his family worked harder each day to prepare for his grandparents arrival. He felt this feeling more and more as he heard how much need his grandparents presented to his parents. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he boarded his flight home for thanksgiving Peter Jason didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. He was still upset with his grandmother for the selfish act of trying to take her own life, what he truly couldn&rsquo;t wrap his head around, is if he wished she had succeeded would that have made all this easier. But then again he hated himself for feeling this way. As he opened the door to his basement his house felt different, there was a different aurora around it. It was like everyone was just waiting for something bad to happen, his thoughts were interrupted as he heard the wheels of his grandmother&rsquo;s walker around the corner. &ldquo;Peter Jason, is that you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Grandma, how are you?&rdquo; He hunched over to giver her a hug and kiss, the first thing his eyes darted to was the white gauze protecting the hole in her throat, the last physical symbol of her failed suicide. He struggled to produce a meaningful smile as he pulled away from the embrace.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing great, healthy as an ox.&rdquo; She said with a laugh and a pinch of his arm. &ldquo;Have you seen grandpa yet?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No I just walked in, I&rsquo;m trying to get there.&rdquo; He talked to her as if she were an obstacle in his way, something he had not meant to do. A little hurt his grandmother followed him to see Michael. &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; His grandfather looked rough, his hair was thin from rounds of chemo, his face baggy with weight loss during the process, and he was so weak he couldn&rsquo;t get up on his own. &ldquo;Stay laying down. I&rsquo;m coming over.&rdquo; Peter Jason said as his grandfather shifted his weight trying to stand. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My grandson,&rdquo; the look of pride in his blue eyes, &ldquo;how has school been. You meet any nice girls?&rdquo; He questioned as he pushed an elbow into his grandson&rsquo;s ribs. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No grandpa, no girls just work and lacrosse.&rdquo; Peter Jason smiled and felt the heat in his cheeks that signaled tears were coming. He stood up and excused himself from their room. That night when he was alone and was sure everyone was asleep Peter Jason sobbed into a pillow. He didn&rsquo;t want his father to see this emotion as he had enough on his plate and Peter Jason could see the signs of weathering on his father&rsquo;s typically young face. Throughout Thanksgiving and Christmas break Peter Jason spent most of his time helping his grandparents in day-to-day activities trying to relieve strain from his parents to make up for missing the truly hard days. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days that were the hardest for Peter Jason was when he was back at school thinking of how much he did for his grandparents and that meant that the duty was passed on to the rest of his family when he was away. It wasn&rsquo;t just the physical strain he felt bad for either, he knew the amount of stress his parents were under and couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. He tried to come home anytime he had a three-day weekend or more time off, but with lacrosse it was tough and even tougher on his schoolwork. He called his mom everyday now and called his father more than twice a week to make sure they were holding up. His parents had described how much worse his grandfather had gotten and how he even struggled to talk or even effortless tasks anymore. His parents&rsquo; descriptions couldn&rsquo;t explain how bad it truly was, something Peter Jason experienced when he surprised his grandfather for his birthday. &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; He yelled as he walked in, he ran upstairs to his couch where he usually sat. &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; His grandfather struggled to turn his head, Peter Jason saw how skinny he was, his mother had told him that he was hardly eating anymore. Michael smiled a pained smile and waved Peter Jason over. Peter Jason knelt next to him, &ldquo;Grandpa, how are you feeling.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Horrible,&rdquo; This was the first time in fourteen years of dealing with cancer his grandfather ever expressed if he was feeling negative emotions to his grandson, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat, I can&rsquo;t sleep, and your grandmother&rsquo;s driving me crazy.&rdquo; Peter Jason thought back to his conflicts with his emotions over his grandmother, this was the first time he thought how much that must of hurt his grandfather. He still couldn&rsquo;t comprehend it all. The rest of the weekend was filled with emotions rejoicing in what everyone knew could be one of the last they were all together. It was a Thursday when Peter Jason&rsquo;s phone rang, showing a call from his father.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad, is something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Grandpa was admitted to the hospital tonight. His cancer spread to his brain and that&rsquo;s what was causing the change in personality and abilities.&rdquo; His dad spoke calmly but Peter Jason could tell he had recently been crying by the cracks in his voice, this hurt him more than anything, not being able to be there for his father. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How much longer does he have?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not long, maybe a week on life support.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip; I love you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you too, son.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going home for spring break in a day and went straight to the hospital to see his grandfather. He walked in and saw his withered grandfather breathing on a machine, while not responding to any stimulus in the room. He grabbed his grandfather&rsquo;s arm and began to cry, he whispered to his grandfather, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taught me so much, how to be a man under stress, how to stay strong in the face in ever growing danger, and how to always be yourself, I love you grandpa.&rdquo; He buried his head into the bed and cried until no more tears came out, he was glad no one was in the room with him. When he had regained his composure he walked out of the room and faced his grandfather&rsquo;s wife, sons, and brothers. Peter Jason tried to sound excited about school and how lacrosse was going but as he talked to them it only came out gravely without much emotion, as he had no more emotion to give. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went home and hugged his father. They talked over a beer for a long time, remembering good memories of their father and grandfather. They talked about how he always tried to set Peter Jason up with the waitresses at restaurants, they talked about his obsession with trying to help someone cook even if it screwed up the dish sometimes, finally they talked about how his personality lit up everyone he ever touched. At the end of their beers his father had tears in his eyes and again they hugged before going back to visit Michael. After two days in the hospital with no real options they moved Michael into a hospice facility where he would be able to live his last days off life support and in the comfort setting that hospice provided. When Peter Jason first went to visit Michael there, he went with his mother. As they sat down the repeated sound of his grandfather&rsquo;s gasping breath tormented him, by making him helpless again. He knew it was just a waiting game until Michael&rsquo;s lungs filled with fluid and he passed away, but still Peter Jason needed to be able to do something. Michael gagged and spit up some fluid, as Peter Jason wiped some off of Michael&rsquo;s chin he felt a wave of nausea that sent him to his knees, he ran outside and puked into a bush. He didn&rsquo;t go back in, he couldn&rsquo;t, he got in his car and drove. He drove for thirty minutes before coming back to pick up his mother. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming home for break, Peter Jason couldn&rsquo;t sleep so he was playing videogames when he heard his fathers phone ring upstairs. He knew what had happened. His father came down the stairs heavily with each step seemingly about to break the stairs; his eyes were a swamp of tears and redness from sleep. James told Peter what Peter already knew, he got off the couch and wrapped his father in a hug. James walked downstairs and told his brothers and mother about what had happened. Everyone came upstairs to have a drink for grandpa and to talk about the joy of his life. The next two days flew by as Lucy&rsquo;s demands to have the funeral in New York were met. After all the arrangements were made, they drove to New York for the wake and funeral. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived at the wake Peter Jason saw the tired, beaten expression on his father&rsquo;s face. He knew he needed to be strong for the rest of his family, as he knew his father could not, as they entered the facility they could see Michael right away. His father went straight to the casket to say a few words and placed Michael&rsquo;s silver cross and rosemary beads into the casket with him. When Peter Jason went to the casket it was the first time his grandfather looked like himself in a long time. The makeup made Michael&rsquo;s face appear fuller and the suit made him look like the ever-smiling car salesman he once was. Peter Jason did not cry as he touched his grandfather&rsquo;s hand for the last time, he did not cry as his sister wailed on his shoulder, or when he hugged the rest of his weeping extended family. At the wake his grandmother asked him to be the last of the pallbearers for the funeral tomorrow, he graciously accepted and hugged his grandmother. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Jason almost cried as a broken image of his father took the podium to deliver the eulogy. The tears began to come when his father through tears of his own told the audience that on one of their last drives to chemotherapy Michael had said he just wanted to see Peter Jason play lacrosse one more time. &nbsp;He gave his father a bear hug as he walked down from the podium and they cried in one another&rsquo;s arms. Finally, as they walked the casket out of the church he could see the strongest of Michael&rsquo;s brothers crying as they left and Peter Jason let out days of tears, weeping, shaking, tying to continue to walk as his feet stumbled underneath him. He continued to pour tears as each family member placed a flower on the casket; finally the casket was closed after his grandmother said her goodbyes. As the casket was lowered Peter Jason thought of the rosemary beads and cross his grandfather always carried, he looked to the sky and smiled. </span></p>
