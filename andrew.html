    <h2>Puzzles</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">Most rooms in a house have a name, or at least some way for people to refer to it, generally based around the main function of that room. Sometimes these names are not fully agreed upon, the difference between a living room and a family room is still hotly disputed in households across the nation. Yet for this particular room in this particular house, there was no dispute: it was the puzzle room. It was called the puzzle room not for lack of other possible names, there was a computer in the corner and more than enough books for the room to be passable as a library, yet it had always been the puzzle room. The room, like others in the house, carefully teetered between an organized mess and a chaotic clutter. An ornate maroon oriental rug swept underfoot and mismatched shelves lined the walls, packed to the brim with a loosely alphabetized collection of everything from </span>
    <span class="c0 c8">Crime and Punishment </span>
    <span class="c0">to </span>
    <span class="c0 c8">The Essential Calvin and Hobbes. </span>
    <span class="c0">A chairless wooden desk in the back corner held a computer swarmed by half-finished crosswords and fully-finished sudokus from the </span>
    <span class="c0 c8">Boston Globe</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;and dusted with orange cat-hair courtesy of Douglas, the family&rsquo;s American Shorthair</span>
    <span class="c0 c8">. </span>
    <span class="c0">The desk&rsquo;s original chair had been perpetually relocated to the round table in the center of the room, which was surrounded by other mismatched chairs and flanked by two floor lamps. Not every table is compatible with a puzzle, some are too small, some too rectangular, but this table might as well have been made with a five-hundred piece jigsaw puzzle already on top of it, at least that&rsquo;s how it lived out most of it&rsquo;s days. The table provided a habitual habitat for unfinished puzzles scattered about, some connected though detached from the full puzzle, others precariously hanging on to the border, still other loners waiting to be matched with their brethren. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">The puzzle room had two main occupants. There was Anna, an eight-year old who approached puzzles with a frantic urgency that often fringed on complete chaos. And there was her father Stewart, a seasoned puzzler who always knew to start with the border and work your way towards the center. &ldquo;Puzzle time&rdquo; as Ann and Stewart called it, occupied that precious interval after Stewart came home from work and before he had to put Anna to bed. Most days, Stewart could get home for maybe an hour of puzzle time, if he was lucky. Other times, he would get home only minutes before Anna&rsquo;s 9:30 bedtime. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Puzzle time?&rdquo; She would ask, excitedly breaking off her hug as he walked in the door. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;No honey, I think it&rsquo;s time for bed instead.&rdquo; &nbsp;He would reply. There were many parts about being a single father that weren&rsquo;t easy. Stewart spent less time with his daughter than the nanny, Christy and often questioned whether she was a better parent than him. Anna had even called Christy &ldquo;Dada&rdquo; once a while back. But none of that could compare to how empty Stewart felt inside when Anna&rsquo;s eyes dropped and her face deflated as she realized that she couldn&rsquo;t spend any time with her father that night, or the previous night, and maybe even the night before that. Sometimes the puzzle room would go unoccupied for weeks if Stewart had a big project at work. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">Stewart was a partner at an advertising agency in Seattle. He was quite satisfied by the work and considered himself lucky to have a job that gave him the means to raise Anna all on his own, even if it meant staying late some nights. His office was littered with pictures of Anna in different stages of development. Anna on the beach, Anna in the snow, Anna napping on the couch. In fact, there was only one picture that didn&rsquo;t feature Anna in some capacity. The frame to the right of Stewart&rsquo;s computer on his desk featured a younger Stewart, without the grey sideburns and frameless glasses, standing next to a quite tall and quite pregnant woman named Sophia. Sophia and Stewart were pictured on a beach, in what looked like early fall. They might have been out to lunch that day, or it might have just been an afternoon walk on the beach. You could tell by looking at the picture that neither of them knew it would be the last they would take together. Sophia had been his wife. She wasn&rsquo;t in any of the pictures of Anna. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">On one particular day when Stewart had been able to get home for puzzle time, Anna and him were working on a quite unrealistic under-sea 500 piecer, featuring most of the stereotypical tropical fish one can think of, a couple sharks off to the side, and an out of proportion orca swimming above. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re having a spelling bee in class next Monday.&rdquo; Anna told her father. &ldquo;Mrs. Lenehan says that the winner doesn&rsquo;t have to do this week&rsquo;s homework.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That sounds exciting, have you been studying?&rdquo; Stewart said without looking up from the bottlenose dolphin he was piecing together.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, no. I&rsquo;m pretty good at spelling so I think I&rsquo;m going to win.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now Banana, you know that you&rsquo;ll have a much better shot at actually winning if you study. I&rsquo;m sure most of your competition is already halfway through the dictionary.&rdquo; Anna looked fraught with worry. &ldquo;Well maybe not halfway, but they&rsquo;re definitely studying.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, quiz me. If I get it right I don&rsquo;t have to study.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, spell onomatopoeia.&rdquo; He snarkily challenged her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna cleared her throat and stood up from the table. &ldquo;Onomonopee-ah&rdquo; she mispronounced. Then, after pausing for dramatic effect &ldquo;N-O. Thank you.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stewart knew better than to laugh, but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Monday evening, when Stewart walked in the door and waved to Christy he noticed that she was perhaps more happy than she had ever been to see him come home. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; he asked her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">Christy rolled her eyes, patted him twice on the shoulder and said &nbsp;&ldquo;Good L-U-C-K.&rdquo; with a chortle as she closed the door behind her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m home Banana&rdquo; He called towards Anna&rsquo;s room. Based on the intentional intensity that Anna exhibited in her walk down the stairs and into the kitchen, Stewart could tell that she probably didn&rsquo;t have as much luck in spelling as she had predicted. As she sighed into a chair at the kitchen table with surprising emotion for an eight-year-old, Stewart lightly asked &ldquo;How was your day at school Banana?&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;B-A-D.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;N-O F-U-N.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you use words please?&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;N-O T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;So I take it your spelling bee didn&rsquo;t go as planned.&rdquo; She gave a tight nod. &ldquo;What word did you misspell?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;C-A-L-E-N-D-E-...&rdquo; She trailed off thinking, then restarted &ldquo;C-A-L-A-N-D-A-R.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Calendar?&rdquo; He asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">Anna&rsquo;s face flushed with pink and she looked down at her shoes before she muttered &ldquo;S-T-U-P-I-D W-O-R-D.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it continued as they bent over the puzzle and through Anna&rsquo;s bedtime, where she bid Stewart &ldquo;G-O-O-D-N-I-G-H-T.&rdquo; Stewart, for his part, chose not to worry about it for the time being, he wasn&rsquo;t very good at discipline anyway. Stewart&rsquo;s plan for parenting had always been to be the good cop and let Sophia be the authority. When she wanted to, she could inflict quite a tone; Stewart had once seen her scold an usher at an Aerosmith concert for telling them they were in the wrong seats when they had actually moved into the wrong seats. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">The next morning after Anna ate her &ldquo;E-G-G-S&rdquo; and left his car with a &ldquo;B-Y-E&rdquo; Stewart assumed the habit would phase out, That is, until he got a phone call from Mrs. Lenehan during his lunch break. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stop spelling out her words&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh gosh, that&rsquo;s too bad. I figured she would S-T-O-P by N-O-W.&rdquo; Stewart chuckled to himself, but regretted his joke as Mrs. Lenehan&rsquo;s tone got a bit more shrill.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anna simply cannot be in class tomorrow if she continues this behavior. I will not have her disrupt my classroom.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll talk to her.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening, Stewart made a point to get home early, and asked Christy to keep Anna occupied in her room for fifteen minutes. When Anna came downstairs to her father&rsquo;s calls she found the puzzle room as she&rsquo;d never seen it before. The table that was normally centered in the room had been replaced by the now uncluttered desk that belonged in the back corner. Atop the desk Douglas napped above a sign that read in big, sloppy bubble letters: &ldquo;Spelling Bee.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And now let us welcome our final contestant, come on down Anna Kirk!&rdquo; Stewart announced. Anna, looking quite flummoxed walked over to the table and stood next to Douglas. &ldquo;So for our viewers at home just tuning in,&rdquo; Stewart said into his imaginary microphone as he turned towards an imaginary camera, &ldquo;this is the final round of our spelling bee and it&rsquo;s come down to Anna and Douglas. Here they are preparing for the final round.&rdquo; He paused for dramatic effect, and broke into a smile as he saw Anna beaming. &ldquo;Ok first up will be Douglas,&rdquo; he &nbsp;announced, getting back into character. &ldquo;Douglas your word is Calendar.&rdquo; Douglas opened up an eye, stretched out his back and opened his mouth. For a split second both Anna and Stewart questioned whether Douglas was actually going to start spelling the word. Douglas broke into a yawn and close his eyes again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Douglas that&rsquo;s incorrect. Now Anna, spell the word correctly and you&rsquo;ll win it all.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna face suddenly took on a solemn determination. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. &ldquo;Calendar. C-A-L-E-N-D-A-R. Calendar.&rdquo; She looked unsure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo; Stewart exclaimed a little too loudly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Congratulations Anna Banana Kirk you&rsquo;re our spelling bee champion.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">Anna broke into a smile and shouted &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; running over to give Stewart a hug. Douglas opened an eye, annoyed at the disturbance. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Now how about we get back to this puzzle?&rdquo; Stewart asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;O-K.&rdquo; Anna remarked, smiling. They both laughed as Stewart went to retrieve the puzzle table from the driveway. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c5">
    <span class="c7">&#11047;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#11047;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#11047;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-five years later, Anna received a phone call.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anna, there&rsquo;s someone in my house&rdquo; Stewart whispered into the receiver.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I was just taking a nap and there&rsquo;s a woman outside, outside my room. I don&rsquo;t know who she is, but she&rsquo;s just sitting there at the table.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad are you sure? It could just be someone else from the home.&rdquo; Stewart lived in Fox Hill, a retirement home for Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients in Hingham, Massachusetts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. No. No! There is someone sitting in my fucking living room Anna what do I do?&rdquo; He was no longer whispering. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my gun, my gun?&rdquo; he asked himself. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad! Do not get your gun, you don&rsquo;t even have a gun anymore. I&rsquo;ll be right over.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in Seattle?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You live in a retirement home in Massachusetts remember? You&rsquo;ve been there for two years.&rdquo; She slowly pronounced her words and paused in between sentences, as one does when speaking to a child, or disciplining a dog. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk, talk, talk to you right now, you&rsquo;re not making sense. I have to go.&rdquo; Stewart said as he hung up the phone. Anna didn&rsquo;t call back. She knew he wouldn&rsquo;t pick up. Instead she called a nurse who sighed and said she would handle it. Anna had been planning to visit Stewart later that day anyway. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c6">
    <span class="c0">Fifteen minutes later, she was driving down I-95 south towards Hingham, traveling exactly the speed limit. Normally, it took her about twenty-eight minutes to reach Fox Hill. Today, she stretched the drive out to well over half an hour. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you know that in 1984, the winning word in the Scripps National Spelling Bee was Luge?&rdquo; Anna asked her father twenty minutes later. She was flipping through an almanac from 1995. He had calmed down and remembered where he was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Luge.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, okay&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that annoying? Like imagine you&rsquo;ve trained for years to get to the finals of the National Spelling Bee and you lose on &lsquo;Luge.&rsquo; Literally hundreds of hours staring at words and never once did they think to learn how to spell &lsquo;Luge.&rsquo; Hundreds of Americans probably know how to spell it&hellip;&rdquo; Anna trailed off as she noticed his gazed fixed on the puzzle set out before them. It showed dozens of hot air balloons drifting about over green, rolling hills. &nbsp;He was fitting together the pieces that formed the basket of a balloon towards the top left. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; he looked up. &ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Luge.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Luge.&rdquo; He responded. &ldquo;So Anna, how&rsquo;s Davis doing? Is he getting by at work?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad, Davis and I have been divorced for over a year, you know that. We broke up last April.&rdquo; She said, more bitingly than she would have liked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh right, sorry I remember that now.&rdquo; He responded unconvincingly. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">They were sitting in Fox Hill&rsquo;s recreation room, one of the common areas in the home. The room was empty except for a man playing solitaire towards the windows on the left. Exactly what type of recreation the room offered was not immediately obvious. In fact, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find any sort of recreation in the room, or really any hint that a human had put any shred of effort into making it an enjoyable place to be. Outside of a couple puzzles, and a deck of cards, undoubtedly containing less than fifty-two cards, the recreation room consisted predominantly of dust. It was also surprisingly organized; the puzzles were neatly stacked on a shelf labeled &ldquo;puzzles,&rdquo; adjacent to an empty shelf labeled &ldquo;games.&rdquo; The ordered nature of this room only served to highlight the lack of actual activities available for recreation. But Anna was okay with all of this. She didn&rsquo;t visit enough to find the sparse puzzles boring, and she figured her father couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference. What Anna hated most was the carpet, colored as if its creator had gotten too drunk on a diet of tequila, green olives and pickles, looked at his vomit and thought &ldquo;hmm this would look delightful if it covered the floor.&rdquo; She preferred not to look at it, which was difficult since it spanned the entire room. Yet this was the only place her father would spend his time. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to tell you something&rdquo; Anna blurted out, trying to make sure he was focusing on her. &ldquo;Scout died.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Scout, your dog. She died last night at my house.&rdquo; Fox Hill didn&rsquo;t allow pets, so Anna had been keeping the dog in her apartment, which incidentally also didn&rsquo;t allow pets. Scout had a nasty habit of tearing up the corners of Anna&rsquo;s couches. Anna was risking losing her apartment just for this damn dog and it wouldn&rsquo;t stop scratching the couches. The dog&rsquo;s death was not unwelcome.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What? No she didn&rsquo;t&rdquo; Stewart contested.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad-&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He interrupted her. &ldquo;She slept in my room last night. She&rsquo;s probably in there right now go look.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna stared at the green bespeckled carpet beneath the table in the recreation room of the Fox Hill assisted living home, reminding herself to breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get her right now.&rdquo; He said, beginning to stand up. &ldquo;Here Scout, here girl!&rdquo; He called, facing door to the empty hallway on their left. A nurse poked her head in, then kept walking down the hallway. He was whistling now. She took a breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll go see if I can find her.&rdquo; Anna exited left out of the room and began to walk aimlessly down the hall. Her eyes itched as she pushed open the bathroom door. She tended to use her distaste for the recreation room as a justification for always wanting to leave sooner than she should. Yet it wasn&rsquo;t that, and she knew. With each visit Anna faded more and more out of her father&rsquo;s mind. The doctors had told her over and over again. It wasn&rsquo;t her fault. She had to to be there for him, no one else could be. This was all so fucked up. She felt like Stewart was just another old useless dog who tore at the edges of her couch just to annoy her. Was she just sitting around waiting for him to die? Would it come as a relief when he finally did?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c6">
    <span class="c0">Anna found herself standing in front of the mirror. She reached into her pocket and grabbed for her eyedrops. &ldquo;Redness reliever&rdquo; read the label on the back of the container. She tilted her head back as the sterile liquid dripped onto her eyeballs, then straightened up and blinked. The artificial tears streaked heavily down her cheeks, dipping into the corner of her mouth. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0 c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;Scout&rsquo;s sleeping I think.&rdquo; Anna muttered as she sat back down in by the puzzle. Stewart had finished piecing together the basket.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. So I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask, how are you and Davis doing?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you fucking kidding me?&rdquo; she snapped, before catching herself. &ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. We&rsquo;re fine Dad.&rdquo; Anna&rsquo;s voice quivered as she sat there, fighting the pressure building up behind her eyes, unsure of what to say. Frankly she didn&rsquo;t want to say anything, she wanted to leave, wanted to speed down I-95 on the way home. </span>

    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;L-U-G-E. Luge. I could&rsquo;ve won that damn thing, where was I in 1984?&rdquo; They both laughed. </span>

    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad&rdquo; Anna snorted, &ldquo;The spelling bee is for kids, you were like fifty in 1984, I don&rsquo;t think you would&rsquo;ve been able to compete.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Remember when you got second place in that spelling bee in fourth grade? You were so upset you had lost that you spelled out every word instead of saying them for three days just to prove you could.&rdquo;</span>

    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Actually I think they gave us a list of words that would be in the spelling bee, so maybe it doesn&rsquo;t really count.&rdquo;</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess we both missed out on the opportunity for spelling glory.&rdquo; He said as he released her hand and returned his gaze to the hot-air balloons floating on the table. He picked up the final piece and placed it into the puzzle, the hot air balloons seemed to dance on the picturesque horizon.</span>
