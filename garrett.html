        <h1>Saving Myself by Serving Others</h1>
        <h2>Garrett Ewanouski</h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early on in my professional life I entered a long stretch of monotony and blandness. I got up at 5am. Boarded the train by 6am and fought my way to get to work by 7, seeing the same miserable faces on the subway that I had the pleasure of encountering each blissful morning. The air on the train always hung heavy with the scent of sweat and fast food breakfast sandwiches the passengers wolfed down on their trek to work. I hated the train. I hated the train not because of the noise or the over-crowded nature of public transportation, but because I knew what boarding that train meant for me- it meant another day grinding at the office. Just the term &ldquo;the office,&rdquo; turned my stomach. I spent countless hours just sitting around there looking for a reason to feel good about myself, and never finding one.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was a 26-year-old accountant, with no interest in accounting. My desk was an eight-hour mental prison to which I was serving a never-ending sentence. Staring at numbers and playing with other people&rsquo;s money made me feel limited and empty. I often times would look up at the ceiling or stare out the window, for what seemed like hours, and wonder why I was there in that grey office and what exactly I was doing for the world.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Peters!&rdquo; My boss Mr. Walsh would yell at me in that gruff and pissed-off voice no one ever wanted to hear, &ldquo;The hell are you doing? Staring a hole in the wall? Do something to make yourself productive.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Peterson, sir&hellip;&rdquo; I would mumble as he clunked down the hallway away from my desk, not wanting to give me the time of day. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mr. Walsh was a large and angry man. He stood six foot three and must have weighed two hundred and thirty pounds, he was a solid brick shit house- and used that to his advantage when hovering over people and demanding more production. He barked orders around the office and his voice echoed throughout the hallways on a daily basis. It was easy for all of in the office to pick up on the fact that he hated work, or maybe he just hated people- regardless he was always sour and certainly not someone you wanted to piss off.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d been working in that job for three years and he still managed to confuse &ldquo;Jason Peters&rdquo; with &ldquo;Jason Peterson.&rdquo; Maybe that&rsquo;s why when I walked into the break room for a cup of coffee he would make eye contact with me and never say anything? That was always a treat- milling around the office and seeing people who I know know who I am, but never acknowledge me or say hello. I wouldn&rsquo;t say Rolfe LLP had a great working climate. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sometimes getting yelled at felt pretty good. Made you feel like you were still alive and people couldn&rsquo;t see right through you, so I didn&rsquo;t always mind it. I liked human interaction, regardless of the tone, and that was certainly something that was missing from my life in the office. But I often did wonder if Mr. Walsh or anyone else even give a shit about me as a person or was my production, or lack thereof, my only value to this company? </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The more I wondered if I really mattered as a person at that job, the more obvious the answer came to be: of course the company didn&rsquo;t care about me, and I didn&rsquo;t really matter to Mr. Walsh, or to Susan who occupied the cube next to me, or even Brendan from down the hall. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tolkien says, &ldquo;not all those who wander are lost.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s nice for Tolkien. My experience was different. Where will I be in five years from now? Could I mentally handle working in an office all these years ahead of me? What&rsquo;s the end result going to be? I couldn&rsquo;t answer these questions but I sure as hell knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be behind that godforsaken desk anymore. I needed something more out of my life and above all I needed a purpose.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">One day, I can&rsquo;t say exactly when because they all felt the same, but </span><span class="c0 c6">one </span><span class="c0">day in the springtime as I schlepped home from another empty day at the office I had a moment of clarity. As I stepped out onto the bustling platform of the train station I suddenly stopped amidst the scurrying crowd and looked into my reflection in a nearby window. When I saw my reflection I felt a great sinking feeling. I saw a man in that glass that I didn&rsquo;t know and I saw a man I didn&rsquo;t like. I saw a man who wasting his time in a rat race- and endless and pointless pursuit of nothing. Now some people gladly put on that monkey suit and fought to get to and from work everyday because they have a family to support or they actually enjoy what they&rsquo;re doing- and that&rsquo;s great for them. Supporting your family is a noble pursuit, but I didn&rsquo;t even have a family. I was just filling up my days by going to the office. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man in the glass looked tired, had slumped shoulders, and looked like just another schmuck in the crowd. Terrible posture, bags under his eyes, disheveled suit, and beat up briefcase. I stood there in that dusty, stuffy subway stop looking at this man in the glass for what seemed like an hour as people pushed to get around me like water flowing around a rock poking out of a river. &ldquo;How did I get here?,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;How much time had I actually wasted in this trivial pursuit of a career?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hated this person in the glass, and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t get back on another train and fight to get to, and get through another day of work. I was so disappointed in myself. I wasn&rsquo;t going to get back on that train. Not today. Not tomorrow, and hopefully not ever again. I was done. If given the option I&rsquo;d have closed that subway down. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">So I hustled up the worn down subway steps up to the beaming light and soft breeze coming from the street. Stepping out from the subway and onto the loud and commuter-packed street felt like I was emerging from the underworld of surfacing after a long time out at sea in a submarine- it was really pretty liberating. In hindsight, all I did was say, &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; to the connecting train and chose to get some exercise, but this was a really nice break from my routine I had been locked into for years. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">So I walked. I walked made my way home through the city neighborhoods, past the markets, past the tattered schools, past the parks that were perfectly nestled into that urban environment. It struck me how much time I had been spending inside in recent years- I either slumped at a desk, crammed into a subway car in the bowels of the city, or loafing around my apartment- all the while neglecting the beauty, both natural and unnatural, of my immediate environment. I missed the natural beauty of the springtime in the city. It was just warming up after a harsh winter, and that fresh sense of a new beginning made me feel excited for the first time in a long time. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I walked, I didn&rsquo;t say anything to anyone passing me, I just enjoyed the crisp air and clambering of the city and the architectural feats that rose up thirty floors from the sidewalk all around me. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I sauntered probably four miles from my connecting train on the route to my apartment when I decided to stop off and get a Coke. I entered &ldquo;Roy&rsquo;s Convenience.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store had one of those bells attached to front door that jingled every time a customer entered and reminded me of &ldquo;The Little White&rdquo; store back in my hometown as a kid. I used to walk there too and grab a Coke after school. I pulled open the cooler door and grabbed a chilled Coke with just a little fogginess on the taut plastic bottle. As I turned around to go towards the register I couldn&rsquo;t believe what was unfolding before me. Two men rammed through the door and sprinted into the store. I can still hear those two harsh jingles of the bell rip through the silence of the little drug store.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first man in, wearing a black ski mask, ran full speed and hopped up onto and then over the counter. The poor clerk had his back turned to him as he was restocking the cigarettes, and never saw it coming. He sprung on the clerk before he could do anything and rained down blows with a ferocious pace. I noticed he was distinctly right handed. I also noticed these two were not fucking around even a little bit. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second man, presumably the look out guy, tossed his buddy a crowbar to pry open the register I had already dropped my Coke in astonishment. I could hear it fizzing and sputtering on the tile floor as I stood staring directly at the door and the guy that provided the crow bar. I stood really still like you would if you were in the woods and a bear spots you. You don&rsquo;t move, don&rsquo;t make a sound, don&rsquo;t make a fuss and hope the beast doesn&rsquo;t notice. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if I were in the woods the bear would have eaten me. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The fuck you lookin&rsquo; at?&rdquo; The second masked man said as he approached me. He was pointing a wooden stick at me, it looked like a wooden souvenir baseball bat or something. Looking back now it&rsquo;s rather puzzling why you bring such a poorly selected weapon to rob a store, but it&rsquo;s also weird why he asked what I was looking at. Well, I&rsquo;m looking at you, one of two men who just bum rushed this little convenience store. I&rsquo;m looking at you, the most threatening figure that&rsquo;s been in my life since I got jumped outside a bar in college. I felt like he was new at this whole criminal thing. He seemed to be looking for a confrontation.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to say, &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; but I said &ldquo;uh&rdquo; and &ldquo;um, um&rdquo; probably fifty times. I was sweating profusely and could feel the sweat dripping down my sides from my underarms. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talkin to you!&rdquo; He closed the distance between us and I was still paralyzed with fear. He was distinctly shorter than me and pretty skinny too. I hadn&rsquo;t really worked out much since I when I played point guard in college but I&rsquo;m still pretty strong and used to mix it up a little in high school- but that was a past life. Now all I do is sit at a desk and stare out windows all day, and now I was scared shitless of this masked character that kept closing on me.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I&rsquo;m sure the other guy jimmied open the register and was stuffing his backpack full of cash and stealing cigarettes and whatever else he could get his hands on behind the counter, but I didn&rsquo;t see any of that. As he approached me I put my hands up as if to say, &ldquo;Hey man, I don&rsquo;t want any trouble I&rsquo;m just a guy trying to buy a Coke,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t think the message got across.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy seemed really nervous and kept asking me &ldquo;Huh? Huh? Huh?&rdquo; as he got closer. His voice wasn&rsquo;t all that deep but this guy meant business and I was so shocked this was actually happening I couldn&rsquo;t respond. I backed up. I backed up more. I backed up until I was up against the chilly, smooth glass door of the cooler full of sodas.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I, I-&rdquo; I squeaked out with the back of my head touching the fridge.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He took one swing at me with that little souvenir bat and he connected. I mean he </span><span class="c0 c6">connected.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;My head whipped to the side from the force of the bat. Blood spattered all over the coolers and the floor, and little pieces of my formerly braces-adjusted teeth sprinkled the ground. My whole body twisted from the force of the impact, my knees buckled, and I landed in a heap on the floor in a pool of rich red blood and long stringy drool. As I was spitting the Chiclets out of my mouth I got up on my hands and knees to see them run back out the door. The whole ordeal took no more than two minutes.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room spun around in circles as I stared at the floor and puddle of blood and spit out the overflowing contents of my mouth in disbelief. I was literally just buying a coke and then got my mouth bashed in by some punk. The puddle of Coke on the floor slowly flowed across the tile and mixed with my blood and broken teeth. Have a Coke and a smile, right?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then the room went black.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The police soon came and the paramedics took care of me when I came to only a few moments later. They stitched up my mouth and gave me some meds for the pain before my emergency dental surgery to save my teeth. Apparently the cops apprehended the two robbers as they fled to store. Turns out a woman passing by saw some commotion going on in the store and made the call. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">My suspicions of the criminals were definitely accurate.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was just a couple of kids,&rdquo; the officer said to me as I sat in the back of the ambulance with blue and white lights shining all around us. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t say anything because I had the paramedic&rsquo;s latex fingers in my mouth so I just spat out a muffled &ldquo;uh huh.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This happens a lot you know,&rdquo; the officer continued without really acknowledging my presence. He was looking at the ground and shaking his head. He&rsquo;d seen this too often was clearly disheartened. &ldquo;These kids. They have no direction. They drop out of school before even finishing high school, and then what? A lot of the time the system fails them, they fall through the cracks. Teachers don&rsquo;t care, their parents either can&rsquo;t help or just don&rsquo;t help- then they&rsquo;re all alone. Many of them get into drugs, others do this type of shit. It&rsquo;s really sad. It&rsquo;s a sad reality. I&rsquo;ve got kids of my own, you know, and I can&rsquo;t believe this shit keeps happening. It&rsquo;s a sad reality.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent a lot of time away from the office after that night. Mostly due to the doctors and dentists appointments that were necessary to repair my broken teeth and split lip, but also partly because I never wanted to go back. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt horrible about that store robbery. I wasn&rsquo;t all that upset about getting smacked in the face, to be honest. It definitely sucked not being able to eat for a while but it also gave me a much needed break from my life. I got to contemplate where I was and where I was going. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The words from the police officer stayed with me and that was what really upset me. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I understand the personal responsibility everyone has to take care of themselves, but I also believe in the good nature of people and I felt so strongly that those kids in the store weren&rsquo;t bad people- they were just directionless kids who fell into the products of desperation. I looked at my own life and knew that I had great parents and a fantastic support system growing up, so I had opportunities. These kids and hundreds of others just like them likely didn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I knew I had to do something, I knew I had to help out my community in some way, do my own little part.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let me cut to the chase here, I quit my job. With enough money saved up I figured I could take some time for myself and figure out what exactly it was that I wanted to do. The underlying factor with all the potential paths I examined turned out to be the simple component of service. Now, I&rsquo;m not going to preach from my high horse about service. I partially wanted to serve others because it made me feel good. It made me feel important, I got to get off my ass in that cubicle and get out in the community and interact with people. I felt that some type of service to the public could make a tangible difference in the lives of others while at the same time giving me a nice sense of fulfillment. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After this rather peculiar period of soul-searching I ultimately decided I wanted to give back to the youth in my community and help them to never get lost wandering in the way that I did, and to find their purpose. I concluded that the most impactful way for me to accomplish this goal would be to become a teacher and a mentor to young adults. Since I already had my degree, I had options and could go teach in public schools as a substitute almost immediately- and that&rsquo;s exactly what I did. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fast forward three months. My mouth is fixed and my teeth are back. Well, not </span><span class="c0 c6">my</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;teeth, they&rsquo;re fake, but they look arguably better than before. Thanks kid. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">My day got off to a great start. I beat my usual 5am workday alarm and felt a little pit of nervousness in my stomach as I put on my khakis and button down and gathered up my notes for class. Can you imagine? Waking up early and not wanting to wait any longer for that day&rsquo;s challenges so you get up and start to attack your work? It felt right.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Amidst all the excitement and buzz of a fresh start to a new school year, I completely forgot one major obstacle to my day: getting to work. I knew I needed to take the train, but never contemplated exactly what that meant. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I tentatively walked down my street towards that same dreary subway station, at the same time exact time as when I was working as an accountant.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t let this be like last time,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make me feel like I did before. I hate this place, I don&rsquo;t want this ruining my experience, I&rsquo;ve already come so far.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt like an alcoholic being back around booze for the first time, struggling to develop a healthy relationship with something that has caused you so much pain. I was scared, I didn&rsquo;t want to fall back into that same pattern, that same depression.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I reached the stairs that descended into the subway I stood on the top step. I took a deep breath, looked up and enjoyed the mixing of the reds and pinks of the sunrise just over the top of the rusted rectangular subway station sign. I took my plunge down the steps.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, wow, looks like they cleaned this place up&rdquo; I thought out loud.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I felt like all those disrespectful, &ldquo;me first&rdquo; type of people also got swept away from the station with the dust and grime that used to be caked to the cement platform floors. People smiled, kept to themselves, and most surprisingly- they didn&rsquo;t piss me off. I felt liberated.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A rush of excitement came over me as the doors to that same car I had been on over a thousand times opened. This was a different time, a different context, a different me. I didn&rsquo;t even bothering fighting for a seat. I was fine standing and couldn&rsquo;t wait for the ride to end so I could get to my new job.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I got off a stop before where I normally did to get to Rolfe LLP, and didn&rsquo;t bother looking back as that subway car screeched and grinded away. I knew where it was going. I knew where I was going, too. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">***</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Mrs. Eberlly,&rdquo; Jacqueline blurted out with a little too attitude for a first encounter.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright everyone take your seats. Good morning!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">No response.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;m Mr. Peterson. I&rsquo;m new here and I&rsquo;m filling in for Mrs. Eberlly for this semester as she is on medical leave, I&rsquo;m the permanent substitute. Welcome to Algebra I.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Algebra was a natural fit for me, given my previous job experience and math degree in college. However, none of that made me feel comfortable standing in front of twenty-seven high school sophomores who didn&rsquo;t want to be in those desks.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a short introduction of myself I decided to start the lesson plan for the day, a simple review of plotting points.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I flipped open my notes, and froze.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, uh&rdquo; I stammered as twenty-seven piercing gazes cut through me all at once. I felt like that kid from the store was closing in on me, and I was momentarily paralyzed with fear again. I felt the sweat dripping down my sides and knew they saw right through my polished external presentation of myself. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How could I relate to these kids? How could I actually help them and fix a broken state and national public educational system all by myself? Was I fucking superman? Where&rsquo;s my cape, is it soaked with nervous sweat too?&rdquo; These negative thoughts swirled around in my head, gaining validity with every stammer.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, uh&hellip;&rdquo; I paused again. I looked at their faces and I imagined that kid from the store looking back at me. I took a deep breath and collected myself. I then remembered why I was here in this tattered and out-of-date classroom. I gained a sense of pride in my pursuit to help others, and now that I put some real faces and names to the &ldquo;youth&rdquo; of my area I felt like this was real, and I felt like it was worth it.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">My feet slowly became unglued from the floor and I moved to sit on the front of my desk, relaxed, and addressed the class.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Close the books, guys&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For now, I just want to talk. This course has historically been very difficult for students and many have not passed. I knew that coming in and I sought out this position for a reason, I want to help you guys. I understand, this is challenging stuff and you all have a lot going on outside of school, and I want to hear about that- give me an idea about who you all are, and what you all do. The numbers and word problems aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, we&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">This informal, not by-the-book, approach caught the students off guard and some of them seemed confused.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll start. I&rsquo;m Jason Peterson and I&rsquo;m twenty-six. I&rsquo;m from upstate, and went to Elmwood College. I played hoops in college, we&rsquo;re a small program but we get some good talent from this area and we had some serious success in the tournament when I was there. Anyone here play ball?&rdquo; I raised my hand to indicate I wanted some participation, some sign of life.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few male students at the back raised their hands and one female student in the front row did too, they nodded and gave me a welcoming look. Common ground.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Instant credibility,&rdquo; I thought to myself.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I recently worked as an accountant,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;but I hated that job. I wanted to work with young people, and give back some of that guidance and direction I received as a young man. I&rsquo;m really excited to be here and to get to work with all of you. Now, let&rsquo;s go around the room here and introduce ourselves, say a few interests, and a fun fact about yourself. I find that when you get to know the people you&rsquo;re working with you can get the best results. Let&rsquo;s start here.&rdquo; I pointed a female student in the front row.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She too was a little nervous, her teachers clearly had never put her on the spot like this before.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is also a good opportunity to work on your public speaking skills, which are also very important, guys. So don&rsquo;t be nervous.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The conversation moved fluidly from person to person, up and down the rows. I didn&rsquo;t retain all the information of course, there was too much all at once and my heart was still racing, but I began putting names to faces. James works two jobs after school, Leah wants to be the first in her family to go to college, Maria is a soprano in the choir. The class period melted away as the students shared their stories and we got to know each other on a basic level.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We finished with about five minutes left in class, not having even touched the material for the day. But that didn&rsquo;t matter much.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you all for sharing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That was definitely helpful for me and I hope you got to learn a bit about each other, too. Before we go I just want to stress that I have an open door policy for all of my students. This means if you are having any issues with school or even outside the classroom, you can feel comfortable coming to me for advice or just an ear. I&rsquo;m glad to help.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some shook their heads, some stared at me blankly. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;First day. We&rsquo;ll get there at some point.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s it for today. Obviously no homework for tomorrow since we spent the whole period chatting. We&rsquo;ll crack open those books tomorrow and get going on some Algebra. You&rsquo;re dismissed.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I turned around to my desk, stacked my papers, and put away my notes.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few weeks I felt some progress being made in terms of the students growing more comfortable with me, grasping the material, and even my own ability to convey the general concepts to them so they could apply the specifics. Not everything was perfect. Some students cut class, others acted out caused distractions, but for the most part my classes went smoothly, the kids respected me, and we pushed through the work. I was however concerned that we were moving at a rather slow pace.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; Principle Morrison called to me one day in the hallway, &ldquo;may I speak with you a moment?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, sir, of course&rdquo; I said.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed you are a little behind in terms of the lesson plan.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I immediately thought back to my old boss hounding me because of a supposed lack of productivity. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now, I think it&rsquo;s not that big of deal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re actually doing quite well. The kids love your class, and the teachers have taken notice.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was stunned. Not that I was having success with the kids, but rather that someone else recognized it. That little bit of validation made me realize it was real.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m getting more and more comfortable with them.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It shows, Jason. Test scores for the units you have covered are up, class attendance is better, and less disciplinary action has been taken. The students are really responding to what you&rsquo;ve got going on in there. Keep it up.&rdquo; With that he gave me a pat on the shoulder and headed back down the hallway, presumably to put out the academic fire of the day. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1">***</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mrs. Eberlly ended up retiring following her leave of absence, and I was offered the position. They didn&rsquo;t even open a job search. The only stipulation was that I get my teaching certification within two years of accepting, so I immediately started taking night classes at City College. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but that was the best part. My job as an accountant was like pulling teeth. Those were </span><span class="c0 c6">hard</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;days. My new life offered me more freedom, more flexibility, more influence, and the ability to work with young people and help them solve their own complex life problems. The hard part wasn&rsquo;t a painstaking countdown until quitting time- it was more of a challenge to get to know my students and to help them achieve at the highest level possible. A distant boss who scrutinized my tangible number crunching no longer measured my performance. Instead, my performance was now based on the development of others. The more the kids grew, the more the kids learned, the better I made their lives- the better I was at my job. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gone were the days of running out of the office at 4:59PM. In fact, I hardly ever walked in the door of my apartment before 9:00PM. Before my own courses I stayed after school giving extra help in not only Algebra I, but many different math subjects ranging throughout eighth to twelfth grade- just because I wanted to and found it both fun and rewarding. Everyday brought a new challenge; every student brought a new story and a new set of circumstances. Some needed a hug, some needed a shoulder to cry on, some needed a boot in the ass- I got good at being a versatile teacher that could do all three. I had passion, I had charisma in front of the students. I consistently beat my alarm in the morning. I was excited to get up and attack a new day of working with young people and doing my small part to positively influence my community. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve stayed in that same position for the past three years and everyday has been a gift. I&rsquo;m thankful that I spent time thinking for myself and being honest about where my life was going. I&rsquo;m thankful to be doing something that I think is important work and the right calling for me. But above all, I&rsquo;m thankful I didn&rsquo;t listen to J.R. Tolkien. </span></p>
